 dinamica fluidos computacional una herramienta fundamental en el analisis procesos equipamientos dinamica fluidos computacional cfd es el nombre dado al area ocupa con la simulacion computacional los problemas flujo transferencia termica en fluidos 
 pendiendo la complejidad las ecuaciones diferenciales rigen estos flujos la preca riedad las computadoras anos atras resolver ecuaciones aunque sim plificadas exigia un gran esfuerzo especialmente en el desarrollo metodos numericos estrategias la resolucion grandes sistemas lineales en las ecuaciones algebraicas 
 petrobras comenzo timidamente utilizar el software cfd en la decada ya el rendimiento del software el hardware disponible en el momento muy limita 
 en la decada habia software comercial sofisticado confiable comple pero continuaba siendo limitado 
 mediados la decada la computacion paralela los metodos numericos robustos los modelos matematicos elaborados fieles la fisica los procesos en combinacion con el hardware accesible potente convierten en el software simulacion las herramientas indispensables en la ingenieria 
 es dificil ima ginar los disenos los procesos sofisticados todavia continuan siendo realizados sin la ayuda herramientas 
 acuerdo con el consultor senior petrobras waldir pedro martignoni abre tr ot saber lo donde cuando los fenomenos producen dentro un equipa miento industrial sido siempre el deseo la ingenieria procesos tambien equi pamientos sin embargo mucho tiempo muchas razones esto fue posible 
 la dinamica fluidos computacional vino responder preguntas convirtiendose en una herramienta fundamental en el proceso analisis 
 donde hay flujo fluidos calor transformaciones quimicas utiliza cfd dijo martignoni 
 el supervisor del laboratorio simulacion numerica en mecanica los fluidos transferencia calor la universidade federal santa catarina sinmec emc ufsc clovis raimundo maliska dice cfd sigue siendo una area nueva sobre todo en brasil 
 la area crecido supuesto junto con el avance las computadoras 
 hasta el ini cio la decada utilizado solamente grandes empresas petrobras tenido sus centros investigacion las universidades en temas investiga cion recuerda el supervisor sinmec 
 segun maliska toda la cadena produccion petroleo gas beneficia los avances en cfd ya la simulacion del flujo multifasico en el reservorio natural petro leo el flujo en los conductos llevan el petroleo hasta la plataforma pasando todos los flujos en los equipamientos refinacion los ductos transporte las valvulas 
 estos flujos son multifasicos complejos 
 solamente con las tecnicas cfd buenas computadoras pueden simular estos fenomenos concluye maliska

 ¿que razones llevaron la creacion del cfd oil clovis raimundo maliska en el ano con la expansion del area cfd en el pe troleo el gas creemos en el encuentro los ingenieros estaban usando cfd en sus proyectos academicos dedicados al desarrollo algoritmos metodos 
 los problemas son multifasicos lo tanto complejos donde muchos los modelos fisi cos estan debidamente testados la interaccion los investigadores ingenieros encargados resolver los problemas es muy beneficiosa ambos 
 el evento junto la academia la industria una tarea siempre facil saca la luz los problemas comunes pueden ser pensados en partes el problema quien resuelve los problemas quien desarrolla algoritmos 
 la quinta edicion del cfd oil prevista 
 ¿como fue posible realizar en menos una decada tantas ediciones un evento dirigido un area tan especifica clovis raimundo maliska el sector petroleo gas crecido mucho en brasil en razon los proyectos investigacion petrobras una empresa siempre pre ocupado la investigacion cientifica sabe los desarrollos importantes caen del cielo requieren estudios las investigaciones constantes 
 asociados con el hecho im portante en brasil han creado leyes requieren la aplicacion las royalties del petroleo la participacion especial en proyectos investigacion el volumen tra bajo cientifico en el area aumento considerablemente tanto en las contrataciones las agencias tradicionales desarrollo traves propia petrobras en sus redes maticas investigacion sus diversos proyectos desarrollo 
 el nuevo impulso dado las actividades requeridas el presal muestra el cfd oil es cada vez presente 
 ¿cual es su evaluacion sobre el desarrollo la investigacion cientifica tecnologica en cfd en el pais clovis raimundo maliska brasil es lider en america del sur en el numero bue universidades en la investigacion 
 es el resultado anos un programa postgrado inicio finales interrumpe cualquier gobierno posterior 
 es decir hoy en dia brasil es un pais capaz desarrollar tecnologia basada en desarrollos realizados sus recursos pedagogicos cientificos 
 todas las areas vestigacion han crecido en brasil el cfd es uno los crecieren exactamen en funcion del aumento la capacidad las computadoras 
 ahora es el momento dar un gran avance tecnologico transformar en la tecnologia los desarrollos realiza 
 sin embargo en sentido vale mencionar una palabra aviso sobre la gesti la investigacion desarrollo en brasil 
 en los ultimos anos establecieron niveles inconcebibles requisitos burocraticos el buen desarrollo la investigacion 
 las modalidades control financiacion la investigacion exigidos entidades bra silenas control son las mismas reglas los proyectos destinados la construcci carreteras puentes 
 eso es inaceptable porque son tareas tienen rela cion alguna 
 las universidades necesitan autonomia administrar sus recursos 
 lo contrario vamos tener los recursos la investigacion tecnologica pero vamos ser capaces utilizarlos exactamente en el momento en listos dar el salto tecnologico 
 el software comercial cfd desarrollado cada ano 
 ¿a medida herra mientas han ayudado los profesionales ingenieria en la investigacion desarrollo innovaciones clovis raimundo maliska herramientas son esenciales fundamentales el ingeniero trata resolver un problema complejo ingenieria 
 software tiene muchos anos investigacion cientifica integrada un conjunto mirado la solucion problemas ingenieria ayudar salvar millones reais gastarian si el ingeniero tuviera desarrollar su propio software 
 herramientas cuando usadas con discre cion usuarios con conocimientos la aplicacion el problema fisico apoyado los datos experimentales cuando sea necesario son esenciales en un entorno moderno di seno desarrollo 
 hay manera hacer los descubrimientos avances sin necesi dad utilizar tecnicas simulacion en ingenieria sean cfd estructuras electromag netica la optimizacion cualquier otra disciplina 
 en su opinion ¿cuales son las tendencias en el campo cfd clovis raimundo maliska cfd es un area puede ir bien mal 
 existe la op cion si tengo el cfd en la compania 
 existe la posibilidad una empresa elegir cfd permanecer en sus viejos metodos diseno consultando manuales el aba co ya estara decretando su falencia el avance la concurrencia 
 decidir esto ria equivalente decidir cuando las computadoras aparecieron la compania permane ceria con las maquinas manuales calcular 
 el desarrollo cfd todo lo relacionado la informatica en la ingenieria debe crecer 
 todo absolutamente todo simulado en la ingenieria 
 los problemas complejos bien conocidos fisicamente con modelos mate maticos aunque debil tendran el apoyo los laboratorios experimentacion junto con la simulacion capaz alcanzar mejores resultados en menor tiempo 
 ¿el cfd oil cumplido sus objetivos waldir 
 martignoni el cfd oil desde el principio cumplido plenamente su objeti vo promover la integracion la academia la industria las diversas institucio nes nacionales incluidos los profesionales experimentados principiantes en particular lanzado nivel internacional trabajos calidad desarrollados en brasil con la participaci profesores investigadores visitantes

 martignoni la participacion profesores investigadores brasil del ex terior sido fundamental tanto la motivacion asi destacar las actividades ternas ambiciones metas alla la sinergia natural promueve el intercambio 
 dentro la refineria los proyectos suelen ser generados debido la necesidad el sarrollo mejorias optimizacion las cuestiones ambientales 
 sin embargo la partici pacion consultores externos ayudado dirigir el trabajo en las necesidades los desarrollos las investigaciones principales el cfd es el camino corto los fundamentos la ciencia la practica aplicacion industrial 
 ¿que beneficios el cfd oil lleva petrobras waldir 
 martignoni el cfd hoy es una teoria es la realidad forma fiable res ponder las preguntas cuando donde las cosas suceden en un proce equipamiento anadimos alla los resultados economicos inmediatos el cono cimiento 
 en el horizonte mediano plazo practicamente todos los procesos industriales seran cientificamente conocidos modelados solucionados traves del cfd tanto optimizados en terminos eficiencia energetica medioambiental seguridad otros 
 asi los beneficios son prometedores 
 ¿como esss consolido en el mercado dinamica fluidos computacional marcus vinicius filgueiras reis esss estado trabajando con cfd desde es decir desde su origen 
 desde el principio hemos tenido un trabajo serio desarrollar una buena base tecnica algo nunca habia hecho una empresa cae en america del sur
