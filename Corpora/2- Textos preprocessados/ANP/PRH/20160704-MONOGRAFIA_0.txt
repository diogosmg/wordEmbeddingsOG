 apresentacao recuperacao avancada petroleo objetiva aproveitar quantidade oleo fica retida pocos maduros 
 tecnica utilizada injecao solucoes contendo substancias restauram pressao interna poco melhoram solubilizacao petroleo 
 surfactantes cosurfactantes compostos utilizados proposito porque reduzem tensao interfacial agua oleo aumentando extracao 
 pocos petroleo existe alta diversidade bacterias redutoras sulfato brs 
 resultado metabolismo destas sulfeto composto pode causar corrosao materiais extracao toxico seres vivos geral 
 surfactante cosurfactante geralmente compostos organicos possivel substancias possam servir fonte carbono brss 
 nesse caso processo potencial aumentar crescimento dessas brs intensificando assim producao sulfeto 
 fenomeno conhecido souring 
 destacase existe literatura trabalhos relacionem consumo biologico desses compostos producao sulfeto brs 
 quantificar efeito producao sulfeto adicao diferentes concentracoes surfactante cosurfactante necessario inovar gerenciamento souring processo recuperacao petroleo 
 alem disso identificar concentracoes nais quais surfactante cosurfactante possam ter efeito negativo souring permite aperfeicoar processo gerenciamento 
 nesse contexto meta deste trabalho avaliar uso mistura surfactante varias concentracoes cosurfactante alcoolico atividade metabolica brs 
 portanto trabalho define tipo efeito intervalos dessas concentracoes 
 resultados mostram producao sulfeto aumentou significativamente intervalo concentracoes 
 maior taxa consumo sulfato mg lh observada concentracao

 alternatively oil industry also investing use srb toxic inhibiting substances tanji al 
 hand little conclusive discussion identification facts contributing increase sulphide production srb eor procedures 
 one reasons confusion surfactant may act inhibitor stimulus srb metabolic activity depending applied concentration microbial species present site 
 srb heterotrophic microbes low concentration species utilize surfactants cosurfactants source carbon energy 
 addition low concentrations substances make oil bioavalilable srb 
 higher concentrations however surfactants cosurfactant may interact cell membrane becoming toxic srb shaban al 
 thus use surfactant cosurfactant enhancing oil recovery take account specific information effectiveness removing oil also information indicating level may cause less problems regarding biological sulphide production 
 surfactants often reported toxic concentrations shaban al

 injecting water supplemented surfactant sulphide may produced ratio

 srb metabolism directly affected surfactant cosurfactant concentrations low concentration may serve carbon source group high concentrations impose toxic response group 
 therefore order guarantee success eor procedures imperative distinguish concentration threshold contribute sulphide production start inhibiting control process production

 lu al demonstrated surfactant concentrations high mg responsible sustaining even increasing microbial biomass 
 contrastingly however badawi al observed log reduction desulfomonas pigra biomass surfactants concentration 
 therefore oil recovery efficiency allied maximum low costs determine amount surfactant cosurfactant used sustaining eor procedure 
 surfactant used significantly high concentrations fact may confer protection oil souring based compound capability inhibiting sulphate reducing bacteria 
 would difficult forecast savings replacement biocides eor procedure 
 apart often less expensive biocides higher amounts ethanol also significantly assist oil recovery

 fact adsorption surfactant enhances corrosion resisting property metal 
 effect commonly observed surfactant concentrations critical micellar concentration cmc 
 time elapses however biodegradation decreases surfactant concentration chemical corrosion may take place 
 nonetheless application surfactant cosurfactant right concentration may better alternative controlling sulphide biological production chemical corrosion alternatives biocides 
 instance cost associated microbial induced corrosion estimated us$ billion oil industry vaidya al 
 therefore correct application surfactant cosurfactant may significantly contribute reducing expenses 
 furthermore supplementation cosurfactant ethanol also increase oil recovery also assist inhibiting srb metabolism 
 toxic surfactant oil concentration often reported concentrations bera mandal 
 distinct species different tolerance toxic compounds case ethanol research shown toxic threshold srb consortium 
 addition srb inhibition ethanol increases oil water emulsion coalescence rates creating smaller micellar aggregates contributes lower probability pore plugging improving eor procedures dahami al 
 ethanol also used improving surfactant solubilisation fold water taylor al 
 nonetheless highlighted water soluble alcohol improve oil solubility whilst less water soluble alcohols increase interfacial tension oil water 
 thus less water soluble alcohols negative effect eor procedure whilst water soluble increase oil recovery dahami al 
 high interfacial tension oil water phase causes injected water bypass residual oil 
 hand lower interfacial tension improve oil flow also favour pore wettability rock formation 
 thus surfactant ethanol mixture good alternative improving pore wettability another pivotal variable hindering oil recovery mature wells jamaloei al 
 conclusion research shows injection liquid containing surfactant cosurfactant oil formation significantly enhance sulphide production concentrations toxic threshold 
 hand combination surfactant cosurfactants injected rock formation microbial inhibiting concentrations practice shows potential increasing oil recovery may also control souring
