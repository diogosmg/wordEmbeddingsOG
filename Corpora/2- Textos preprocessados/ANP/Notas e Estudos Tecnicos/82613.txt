 seismic testing would undertaken stage 
 seismic exploration uses artificiallygenerated sound seismic waves image subsurface geological conditions 
 vibration source used generate seismic waves near surface typically dynamite charges arranged array large vibrating plate attached base heavy duty vehicle see 
 receiving devices called geophones placed geometric array surface detect seismic signal partially reflected back subsurface geological features changes rock type faults 
 seismic exploration involves acquiring seismic data along single line geophones detect reflected seismic energy generated vibration source 
 gives data twodimensional vertical crosssection 
 surveys use grid geophones vibration source points gather seismic data area rather single crosssection range different angles 
 essentially provides picture subsurface conditions resulting much detailed information building geological model 
 vibroseis commonly used method seismic survey involves employment large truck mounted vibrator units well support vehicles data recording
