 introduction legal institutional changes infrastructure industries brazilian economy went presented similarities 
 major changes enactment new laws creation independent regulatory bodies promotion competitive environment markets 
 competition implemented possible encouraging entry new players implementing end public monopolies key segments industries 
 sectors moreover competition introduced adoption bidding mechanisms 
 paper analyses two particular choices bidding system concession leases oil gas exploitation auctions electricity commercialization 
 intends analyze bids adopted commercialization electricity concession oil gas exploitation fields 
 viewpoint set rules initially applied presented compared results obtained well modifications improvements changes path implemented afterwards 
 introduction one primordial objectives reforms implemented brazil mids infrastructure sectors introduction competitive pressures industries traditionally characterized organization based stateowned monopolies 
 according carneiro convergence different models adopted distinct segments deregulation industries general based construction marketoriented governance structures 
 changes legislative regulatory dimensions adopted general rules could enacted allowed among changes introduction competition pressures many segments infrastructure industries 
 particularly energy industries possible create competitive markets solution adopted introduction competitive pressures construction auction mechanisms 
 choice however obtain expected results 
 electricity industry brasil went supply crisis part credited design wholesale market created 
 segment hydrocarbons exploration production likewise results agent behavior observed different expected ones 
 next section present short synthesis main contributions auction theory problem introducing competition segments typical market structure lead efficient results 
 third section analyze choices made adopted models implemented rules light outline presented previously pointing similarities differences experiences 
 finally preliminary conclusions presented 
 th iaee european energy conference energy markets sustainability larger europe auctions economic theory auctions become popular instruments among governments policy makers general offering leases public concessions operating decentralized markets passing privatization state owned companies use grown last two decades empirical significance 
 brazil used auction mechanisms infrastructure reforms typically government needed buy supplies concession leases offers 
 instrument still extremely popular mandatory several public expenses law 
 increase utilization new types auctions designed suggested means serving public interest new rules must analyzed order grant expected results reached best possible way 
 design auction mechanisms specially introduction procompetitive rules sale auctions one themes became popular study objects last decades presently auctions rules instruments arrangement interaction allow prediction whether expected results likely achieved literature empirical experience better developed 
 two different situations analyzed article auctions concessions leases hydrocarbon exploration production rights auction auctions electricity commercialization determination market long run price electricity 
 regarding first situation leal emphasizes main objective bidding process sale public goods fact seller government know precise value good put sale though general minimum price stipulated asymmetry information characteristics transaction allow way extracting private information agents least part 
 one commonest objectives type mechanism maximization sale result society represented process public agent promoting auction 
 alternatively use auctions mechanisms price determination used according carneiro goods value standard instance price question depends conditions supply demand specific moment time recalculated transaction occurs electricity 
 identification institutional rules auction important rules influence agents strategies bids also determine allocation efficiency goods object auction 
 economic literature identifies auctions competitive noncompetitive auctions first ones focus paper 
 five basic types auctions sales english price ascendant auction dutch price descendant auction discriminatory auction first price auction second price auction double auction 
 furthermore competitive auctions classified according configuration open closed bids auctions uniform price auctions multiple price auctions private common value auctions 
 pointed however far mor literature sales auctions aquisition auctions 
 due paper length limit attain specific kind particularities 
 descriptions auction see instance carneiro duraes 
 first distinction refers way bids presented open auctions bids proposed publicly closed bids presented sealed envelopes opened time 
 second distinction refers esteves 
 th iaee european energy conference energy markets sustainability larger europe many possibilities choice auction design crucial decision policy maker 
 one aspects interest public bureaucrats determining sales auction rules results literature concerning potential revenue type auction results terms resource allocation instance situation hydrocarbons exploration production leases 
 electricity commercialization auctions hand results must balance distinct objectives price determined attend tariff moderateness goal investment incentives supply security 
 situations convenience auction modality depends several hypothesis market characteristics goods characteristics bidders risk aversion behavior number bidders information available 
 also policy choice determines kind auction industry must appropriate compatible objectives presented 
 addition take account fact set rules adopted determines result 
 auctions brazilian energy industries though auctions able present results close ones expected competition use inappropriate types unsuitable peculiarities sector disastrous 
 necessary compatibility evaluation model chosen objectives claimed also careful analysis industry characteristics auction inserted 
 practical questions like budgetary restrictions market concentration demand supply elasticity must addressed 
 particularly market power especially relevant brazilian hydrocarbon industry 
 given regulatory process reflects large extent learning process regulatory agency models auction chosen must object improvements time always taking north objectives public interest defined brazilian case law 
 two distinct experiences analyzed section auctions oil gas exploration production leases promoted national oil gas biofuels agency anp electricity long run commercialization auctions promoted national electric energy agency aneel 
 price paid participants winning bidders pay price uniform price auction bidder pays individual price multiple price auction 
 finally auctions classified private common value auctions according bidders evaluation good private value auctions bidder evaluation subjective non dependent bidder evaluation common value auctions bidder value goods objective value 
 private value auctions price determination individual problem bidder valuation distinct participants 
 alternatively common value auctions goods unique value bidders everyones valuation connected carneiro 
 auction mechanisms studied paper traditionally identified common value auctions 
 object auctioned bidders standard value defined auctioneer regulatory agencies industry although bidder private information allows determine bids infer players bids 
 vickrey one first authors study auctions point view 
 works analyzes open auctions versus sealed auctions comparing ones results terms revenue 
 also presents attempts characterize optimal auctions income maximizing auctions uses strong hypothesis duraes 
 carneiro presents interesting synthesis agent strategies type auction 
 author presents also analyze special cases model collusion entry winners curse risk behavior resource allocation 
 th iaee european energy conference energy markets sustainability larger europe 
 oil gas leases auctions anp adopted rights allocation auction competitive first price closed envelope multiunit simultaneous auction 
 winner highest bid bids must presented sealed envelopes must contain bids areas agent interest economic theory indicates type chosen anp adequate hydrocarbon industry characteristics 
 particularly type chosen fits objectives declared auctions declared previously one preeditals 
 first hydrocarbon reserves items resale possibilities market value estimated unknown characteristic presence oil gas fields area common value auction therefore required 
 adoption first price sealed envelope auction however induces bidder offer bid lower subjective evaluation good proved incentives different behavior bidders offer price high enough beat second best offer 
 auction rules designed order induce maximum approximation bidders offers real evaluation 
 finally adoption royalty payments informational variable stimulates competition winning bid must present strong proposals exante also expost offer transfers part bidders risk auctioneer case brazilian government depend posterior result collect part revenue 
 auction prenotices usually present similarities regarding auction operacionalization 
 show also rules evolution adequacy objectives proposed 
 given existent relation type auction strategic cooperative behavior agents monitor restrict behaviors imposed regulatory agency 
 otherwise agents internalize omission strategies results worst serious agents might loose interest participating futures auctions 
 clearly auctions oil gas leases must considered multiunity auctions 
 however countless difficulties development general theory sale object simultaneously 
 main one new strategic relations possible combinations sold goods 
 economic theory shows context multiunity auctions format adopted auctioneer alters significantly results regarding strategic behaviors also regarding bidders decision rules auctions expected result 
 objects sold sequentially simultaneously brazilian case former chosen 
 broad goals terms energy policy determined law 
 directives must observed process however fixed national council energetic policy cnpe resolutions 
 diretrizes devem ser observadas anp implementacao politica energetica nacional fixadas conselho nacional politica energetica cnpe resolucoes

 rules induce agents offer signature bonus minimum exploration programs best represent expectative winner one highest expectative regarding one particular area bid sufficiently close disposition pay 
 oil gas leases auctions payment carried bidder exclusive function bid also function additional information acquired subsequent moments

 th iaee european energy conference energy markets sustainability larger europe consideration results obtained auctions since implementation introduced change rules aiming stimulate entry new agents reduction behavioral barriers entry represented strategies incumbent enterprises sector disincentive strategies perceived opposite public interest objectives 
 change based understanding better pro competitive rules would favor smaller companies entry would also stimulate competition among agents already present hydrocarbon industry 
 new rule adopted initially mature basins consisted limitation two bids operator per company per area 
 next year adjust necessary limit extended four fields per sector became part rules following auctions 
 observation results achieved change rules agents behavior basins limit anp decided enlarge restraint would applied almost totality areas offered unifying bidding rules 
 rules unification generated praises medium small companies subject strong complaints mainly petrobras companies adopting strategies although illegal incompatible objective proposed 
 although ministry tried intervene process name predominance public interest private one new rules maintained 
 attempt interference ministry mines energy mme process however stressed necessity strong autonomy regulatory agency easy politicians confuse public private objectives confuse countries welfare public company results terms profits th brazil round early interrupted judicial decision 
 anp found therefore obliged discuss judgment legitimacy rules changes agencys competence 
 represents improper interference judiciary regulatory agencys decisions weakens credibility process return rules original statusquo may interpreted undue interference regulatory process 
 electicity comercialization auctions reforms electricity industry many countries passed adoption kind auction mechanism energy commercialization segment way reproducing market governance system resources allocation 
 despite present since beginning reforms auctions applied differs among time country use modified observation initial results experiences well modification objectives governments regulatory agencies 
 following example others countries brazil initially designed electricity industry starting premise electricity commodity carneiro therefore could commercialized wholesale shortterm markets interaction among supply item 
 prenotice th brazil round 
 brazilian electricity industry uses types auctions instance auctions transmission lines leases 
 energy commercialization auctions however chosen case present good example fo evolution norms role public institutions rupture periods 
 th iaee european energy conference energy markets sustainability larger europe demand would give efficient price would provide market incentives long run investment electricity generation 
 mae designed multiunit auction model uniform price sealed bids since bidders share information among prices quantities determined agents bids 
 maes flaws terms investment allocation noticed lot resistence changes suggested time 
 failure maes experience led socalled crise apagao caused revision model action adopted also basis premises behind choice 
 crisis period brazil international experience long identified fails mechanism price manipulation agents trend market concentration adopted measures correct reformulating shortterm auctions formats using types auctions 
 particular verified bilateral energy concentration mechanisms shortterm contraction suitable guarantee long term supply prevent energy crisis types auctions used commercialize energy longrun specifically auctions distributors buy energy 
 given main goals low tariffs making sure energy supply require rules foster private investments great change implemented 
 change encompassed auction systematic also institutional frame energy sector 
 regarding energy commercialization two trade enviroments created law 
 free contractiong environment acl regulated contracting environment acr 
 distinction commercialization mechanism consumers allowed enter one sellers may operate environments 
 acl constitutes free bilateral market similar mae industries large consumers may operate 
 environment electricity distributors must contract demand prevision acr electricity trades operated medium long run electricity contract auctions 
 offer curves created bids made energy generators 
 confronted demand curves resulted demand bids offer curves represented energy prices time 
 roxo claims intensity energy supply crisis took place brazil imposed step back environment strong coordination companies institutions sector 
 measures employed overcame crisis enough ensure safety energy supply 
 result complete process revision legal framework established triggered 
 new institutional model energy sector implemented 
 according carneiro rules implemented second half determined energy commercialization pricing policy come bilateral negotiation among agents 
 structure however reach intended goals 
 aneel remained regulating agent conceding power also directly responsible recently created ccee energy trade chamber coordination energy auctions 
 mme plays key role planning coordinating industry assessing approving measures rules documents 
 also created socalled energy research company epe reply facts caused crisis general idea epe would better plan monitor industry 
 distribution companies must inform demand prevision electricity amounts necessary attend mme 
 based information aneel provides auctions among generators supplying distributors period time given price 
 also small adjustment shortterm auctions distributors total demando predicted bought sold idea reduce minimun agents necessity electricity real time commercialize larger contracts operations could disturb shortterm market open space strategic behaviors 
 information long run energy auctions transition period see decree 
 th iaee european energy conference energy markets sustainability larger europe auction mechanism longer responsible investment incentives allocation base epes studies mme planning industry expansion centrally indicating expansion requirements 
 auctions responsible mainly price determination 
 carneiro points however clear rules presented law general characteristics mechanisms 
 scenario institutions actions choices fundamental determines auctions rules rules different auction agents strategies 
 new electricity sector institutional framework instrument makes feasible adequate supply allied tariff moderateness still auction 
 bad results perceived adoption pure short term auction however need implement long term contracts energy commercialization perceived 
 additionally given particular characteristics industry different types auctions one single model market implemented 
 iv conclusion reforms energy industries brazil went trough aimed potential results competitive mechanisms 
 segments particular introduction competition verified alternative structures governance sought reach results expected competition terms resource allocation efficiency social welfare 
 mechanisms auction adopted part exogenous competition policy fundamental instruments sectorial policies implemented 
 industry particular characteristics objectives designs adopted one distinct 
 institutional behavior regulatory agencies political interference mainly form mme however 
 hydrocarbons industry exploratory concession leases auctions utilized successfully around world model adopted rarely questioned suggestions improvements general concentrate adjustments eache specific situation 
 electricity industry hand many auction mechanisms utilization experiences lead failures fact even experiences often presente success cases critics 
 particular brazil faced problems mechanisms chosen electricity industry first reform 
 model established decade based wholesale short term market entered collapse failing completely attending main objectives 
 flaws noticed crisis corrected partially due evaluation mistakes partially due resistance market changes 
 result market institutions reformulated new institutional framework contracting mechanisms created 
 hydrocarbon rupture observed concession leases auctions promoted since rules virtually 
 results however entirely satisfactory mains objectives fulfilled non desirable strategic behaviors observed led gradual implementation changes 
 process definition new auction mechanisms started major supply crisis left alternative 
 need changes rules clear expected agents legitimacy aneel establishing rules questioned significant way 
 th iaee european energy conference energy markets sustainability larger europe hydrocarbon industry hand adjust attempt strongly rejected dominant agent industry occasionally bunged judicial power 
 despite objectives determined law concession leases auctions attended best possible way necessary modifications interrupted beginning 
 finally cases empirical experience lower decade works subject published 
 auction mechanisms design brazil however involves several questions particularities sector still need better researched 
 process restrain political interference validation technical decisions urgent 
 also objectives public interest aimed clear sealed eventual contaminations private profit driven interests public companies 
 carneiro points mechanisms built consensus agents involved risky 
 infrastructure sectors auction mechanism adopted reflect competitive objectives reached trhough institutional agent independent regulatory agencies capable imposing rules accept attending social groups references almeida
