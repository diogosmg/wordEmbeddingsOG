 br overview since end formal government interference production automotive fuels prices brazil 
 decade brazilian government implemented several structural legal changes different industries including oil gas 
 changes part comprehensive state reform intended change mechanisms directing state participation economic life brazilian society 
 specifically oil industry flexibilization state monopoly allowing companies petrobras operate concession contracts state permissions followed several small changes culminated beginning liberalization automotive fuel prices creation regulatory agency absence kind official control fuel prices brazil since january liberalization process completed 
 nevertheless given extensive market share petrobras private company brazilian government majority shareholder fossilbased automotive fuel prices maintained considerable stability time 
 unofficial policy consistent governments objective price stability contrasts sharply oscillation prices occurring international oil oilproducts markets 
 however consumer gasoline prices brazil followed atypical pattern due essentially behavior supply demand ethanol country due extensive brazilian flex fuel fleet article argue although brazilian gasoline market reflect international price movements international market sugar ethanol plays significant role definition prices quantities products domestic brazilian market 
 several companies petrobras present production commercialization sugar cane sugar ethanol brazil therefore brazilian government much less room intervention prices established economic agents sectors quantities offer compared oilderived fuel market

 brazilian oil industry traditionally characterized strong presence interference government activities 
 brazilian government constitutional monopoly exploration production importation refining transportation oil derivatives operated directly sectors state company petroleo brasileiro 
 although distribution retail sales automotive fuels state monopolies also suffered strong state intervention operated several controls prices sales margins freight costs 
 fuel prices control beginning instrument used brazilian government energy policy purposes also mainly control rising inflation rates impact economy 
 souza silva points strategic management petrobras regarding oil products pricing goods services purchases policy r&d determined environment sectoral goals always lined macroeconomic objectives 
 organization oil industry state monopoly made possible attempts maintain consistency goals 
 however brazilian government implemented several structural legal changes different industries including oil gas 
 changes part comprehensive state reform intended change mechanisms directing state participation economic life brazilian society 
 specifically oil industry flexibilization state monopoly allowing companies petrobras operate concession contracts state permissions followed several small changes culminated beginning liberalization automotive fuel prices creation regulatory agency absence kind official control fuel prices brazil since january liberalization process completed 
 main justification changes government failed effectively managing sectors necessary change way brazilian state participated economic life brazilian society 
 promulgated part new brazilian antitrust policy state intervention reduced enable companies petrobras participate segments oil production chain 
 set basic principles governing activities oil oil products natural gas industries anp 
 law created national petroleum agency agencia nacional petroleo anp whose main goal regulate contract monitor activities inherent oil oil products natural gas biofuel industries brazil

 automotive fuels distribution commercialization regulatory changes envisioned competitive pressures two different mechanisms imports local production companies 
 scenario free prices import might expected price petroleum derived automotive fuels brazil would follow trends observed international market given possibility arbitrage 
 comparison gasoline prices brazil foreign markets onwards demonstrates significantly different trends prices internal brazilian market considerably stable long periods time despite variations foreign market prices see graph 
 broadly speaking reason behind market behavior although brazilian state eased monopoly oil oil derivative industry ceased intervene pricing means indexing price oil products still controls petrobras 
 brazilian state major shareholder petrobras therefore able direct company follow pricing policy consistent government macroeconomic aims price stability low inflation 
 furthermore even though legislation permitted companies operate fields oil refining fuel import segments remain largely concentrated hands petrobras 
 petrobras held countrys refining capacity constructing refineries 
 terms traded volume petrobras accounted production stage gasoline sales refineries 
 data demonstrates although automotive fuel prices officially set brazil petrobras significant market power define price levels gasoline fossilbased automotive fuels country practically controls refine import stage gasoline production chain 
 must observed gasoline prices behavior due discussed later paper fuel ethanol prices controlled petrobras 
 nonetheless petrobras lack capacity sustain stable price trajectory explained mainly ethanol markets structure 
 one keep mind gasoline ethanol prices carry significant weight countrys main inflation index national consumer price index indice nacional precos consumidor inpc control fuel prices country historically instrument used government control inflation impacts economy 
 accordingly observed following liberalization fuel prices brazil government introduced social contribution tax contribution intervention economic domain contribuicao intervencao dominio economico cide amongst goals serving buffer possible fuel price variation country 
 recent years increases decreases production cost gasoline set whole part respective increases decreases cide impact final consumer variation refinery prices tends minimal nonexistent 
 direct contrast production prices ethanol historically subject seasonal variation line sugarcane harvests intercrop periods 
 price trends influence prices subsequent stages productive chain distribution resale therefore great variability resale prices ethanol throughout year

 second half nevertheless witnessed major structural change market automotive fuels brazil appearance growth significant flex fuel lead ethanol market bear influence gasoline market move anticipated government undermined ability petrobras keep track products prices since longer enough control gasoline production imports control products prices 
 another important distinction ethanol gasoline market relates regulation respective value chains 
 already stated regulation entire gasoline chain production within competence anp since 
 regulation value chain ethanol fuel issue provisional measure n° april shared ministry agriculture farming supply ministerio agricultura pecuaria abastecimento mapa anp 
 mapa body legal competence industry end production ethanol fuel stage anp took beginning fuel distribution stage 
 reasoning behind division competence ethanol product derived sugarcane petroleum anp competence production stage chain 
 fact raw material sugarcane plant converted ethanol fuel also converted products essentially foodstuffs 
 change regulatory regime applicable ethanol fuel consolidated conversion provisional measure n° law 
 introduction new law anp commenced wideranging process edition revision series norms order align ethanol production segment new legal provisions 
 process proved major challenge regulator given scale new attributes include duty guarantee supply ethanol fuel throughout national territory well authorizing monitoring significant amount ethanol plants 
 challenge becomes even greater consider legal change occurred context internal supply ethanol encountering serious difficulties also regulatory body seeking assist governments costcutting policies reducing expenditure freezing hiring new staff 
 finally seasonality typical agricultural products sugarcane means price ethanol fuel becomes focus debate annual basis 
 due combined effect intercrop periods sugar cane cultivation said periods naturally promote seasonal increase price ethanol together trend increased demand ethanol internal external markets realignment prices result government measures combat tax evasion 
 measures include marking ethanol fuel colorants 
 combined effect factors exerts pressure price ethanol fuel consumer 
 thus even though variations prices common agricultural produce seasonal foreseeable affect final consumer consumers seasonal income able stockpile products individual consumption 
 years prior consumers access product low cost whilst intercrop periods increase prices potential restrict consumption 
 shall see onwards market conditions product changed way increase ethanol prices levels expected society impacted significantly final price gasoline final consumer 
 parallel effect seasonality typical sale agricultural products naturally pressures ethanol fuel prices upwards sugarcane intercrop periods increasing internal demand hydrated ethanol result increase fleet biofuel vehicles introduced additional element pressure fuel prices

 traditionally price increases ethanol intercrop periods economic incentives sugarcane producers bring forward harvest words beginning harvesting cane programmed period make price increases 
 impact bringing forward harvest prices previous years generally began felt mid february march prices entered trajectory decline 
 however heavy rains affected main production regions center south disrupted mechanism bringing production forward contributed increased imbalance supply demand hydrated ethanol country 
 therefore supply anhydrous ethanol suffered severe restriction time due intercrop period difficulties bringing harvest forward well due reduction volumes produced plants greater expected increase demand automotive gasoline

 particularly relevant given growth share flex fuel vehicles national automotive vehicle fleet 
 context provisional measure mp introduced subsequently converted law 
 transferring production stage ethanol sphere competence anp 
 therefore represented major shift position brazilian government 
 although government inserted ethanol national fuel matrix since left production regulation ministry agriculture 
 words treated agricultural product raw material sugarcane 
 thus passing new law ethanol regulated basically agricultural markets mind seen energy asset fundamental country 
 change regulatory paradigm series institutional consequences industry required anp set new regulatory regime order exercise new duties 
 also need monitor compliance new regulations range agents falling within scope anp regulation 
 one main challenges agency guaranteeing internal supply ethanol 
 two resolutions drafted end resolution anp n° resolution anp n° main provisions include establishing criteria acquisition formation anhydrous ethanol stocks short new resolutions provide distributors contract advance anhydrous ethanol production plants must maintain ethanol stocks compatible expected demand 
 proving contracts required acquisition gasoline noncompliance new regulations would imply heavy fines caught contracts low stocks 
 seen new resolutions particularly anp resolution n° focus initial stage least minimizing risk shortage internal supply anhydrous ethanol makes gasoline sold final consumer brazil 
 increase price anhydrous ethanol principal factor responsible significant increase price gasoline experienced first semester brazil 
 given short period time elapsed since issue resolution given period time granted anp enable economic agents adapt new norms yet possible carry practical analysis efficacy new anp measures ethanol fuel market

 novelty least concerning brazilian analysts introduction new discussion problem prices behavior particularly analysis structural component observed trend far observed effects correlation markets specially loss petrobras capacity influence automotive fuels consumer prices due least part unintended effect brazilian government policy incentives flex fuel vehicles 
 important note high levels observed prices hydrated ethanol brazil may explained mainly basis typical movements market seasonality production ethanol given existence sugarcane intercrop periods increase demand recent years due principally significant growth fleet biofuel fuels opportunities export sugar period high prices international market 
 regarding behavior gasoline distribution retail prices early explained increase volume gasoline consumed particularly state paulo result significant increase price hydrated ethanol fuel sugarcane intercrop period major migration consumers gasoline particularly mid february onwards significant increase 
 price anhydrous ethanol fuel first week january third week april year result sudden pressure demand facing short term inelastic offer since production could expanded climatic reasons years supply could increased short term bringing forward sugarcane harvest 
 may beginning sugarcane harvest downward price movement began country average resale prices hydrated ethanol decreasing 
 common gasoline decreasing 
 first last week may 
 however ethanol prices remained throughout year still high compared previous years since still supply constraints high international prices sugar non fuel ethanol pushing fuel ethanol prices upwards 
 closing important highlight fact provisional measure april subsequently converted law 
 conferred anp competence regulate monitor national production ethanol 
 putting practice however required series fresh regulations issued throughout 
 therefore practical effects regulatory measures impact behavior fuel prices brazil yet observed 
 almeida points discovery pre salt oil areas brazil found facing political temptation keeping domestic fuel prices consistently prevailing international market 
 oilexporting countries yielded temptation bringing large negative impacts economic energy policy 
 analysis current brazilian political scene indicates duel inflation controls versus rational pricing policy first seems taking advantage 
 however indicated paper considering growing demand pricing correlation gasoline ethanol brazilian markets artificial maintenance automotive fuel price levels may prove increasingly difficult impossible least manner adopted far
