 br keywords gasoline price brazil china policy introduction rise oil prices since become urgent lot countries even limited period adopt pricing policies oil products particularly gasoline diesel order fix domestic prices levels prevalent international market 
 purpose policies mitigate inflationary pressures therefore prevent emergence popular dissatisfaction especially context also characterized rise food prices 
 true subsidy fuel prices recent phenomenon 
 past decades several countries particularly oil exporters setting domestic fuel prices line cost extraction international prices 
 rise oil prices last decade opportunity cost policies increased exporting countries 
 hand several countries compelled adopt fuel pricing policies given strategic nature energy input economic performance inflationary impacts 
 nevertheless adoption pricing policy petroleum products implies significant costs especially public finances 
 coincidence today several countries considering implementation measures reduce simply eliminate fuel subsidies 
 indonesias government turned oil exporter importer last decade faced strong popular resistance reducing fuel subsidies whose impact public accounts significant platts 
 nigeria government president jonathan go partially back measures reduce fuel subsidies wave protests swept country associated press 
 hand pakistan taiwan recently successful reducing subsidies measures platts 
 aim paper thus present main objective conditions restrict one countrys ability implement pricing policy order decrease dependence fluctuations tendencies international markets well illustrate comparative way experiences brazil china adopting policy 
 objective conditions adoption pricing policy petroleum products firstly necessary clarify main advantages highlighted economic policy makers implementing pricing policy petroleum derivatives 
 order achieve goal shall look work economist 
 tinbergen nobel laureate economics pioneer construction econometric models 
 according tinbergen achieving number objectives economic policy requires policy makers provided number instruments otherwise could face policy dilemmas depending circumstances 
 example want achieve two policy objectives maintaining certain level growth low inflation one instrument 
 interest rate dilemma increasing interest rates may contribute lower inflation hand adverse effect growth rate 
 order get dilemma creation new instrument pricing policy petroleum derivatives contribute reducing inflation without accepting turn reduction economic growth rate 
 important remember generally speaking fuel prices tend significant weight inflation rates attractive use fuel prices order combat inflation 
 addition fuel prices fundamental ensure competitiveness economy given oil main source energy countries 
 important note oil taking key strategic role since world war emphasized oil shocks situation changed due low price oil international markets oil came seen many analysts commodity like without special strategic importance 
 however since driven growing consumption china developing countries oil prices initiated period rising reflects intrinsic characteristics low price elasticity demand means even substantial price increases low impact consumption low price elasticity supply since oil scarce resource huge investments significant period time necessary supply might increase high income elasticity demand given much incremental demand oil directed transportation sector consumption associated increased acquisition vehicles personal transport transport goods whose behavior tends follow closely gdp 
 new scenario doubts role oil sustain current levels living standards world economic growth 
 nevertheless adoption pricing policy petroleum products detached prevailing international market depends existence objective conditions whose nature structural vary country 
 put another way adopting pricing policy segment possible long run without certain requirements go beyond mere political 
 one main constraints related fact net importer oil oil products 
 extraction costs usually substantially lower prices international markets 
 words big surplus generated oil industry allows flexibility determination petroleum prices without representing absolute loss added value economy 
 however country net importer oil refineries need acquire abroad certain proportion oil prices set international markets 
 refining margins generally low compared economic activities margins generally isnt much space adopting oil prices different practiced abroad without incurring losses least portion petroleum derivatives refined imported crude oil 
 extreme situation country import crude oil even oil processed domestic refineries oil prices could set prevailing prices international market without representing financial loss refining companies 
 moreover depending foreign exchange restrictions weight oil imports trade balance adoption domestic petroleum product prices levels substantially lower international market become even difficult 
 countries whose currencies convertible economic growth limited constraints balance payments 
 country cannot indefinitely accumulate debt long run according thirlwalls law rate economic growth depends relationship rate export growth income elasticity demand imports thirwall hussain 
 oil trade balance varies considerably time depending levels crude oil reserves supply side per capita income consumption side 
 oil trade balance static political challenge making changes petroleum derivatives prices objective conditions change 
 important clarify however country net exporter oil necessarily adopt pricing policy petroleum products increases distance domestic international prices 
 may undesirable especially country wishes increase energy efficiency input question could long run harm development alternative fuels without considering yet possible alternative uses resources question 
 however net importer adoption domestic oil products prices international market means country move surplus generated sector economy society whole somehow makes explicit costs implied policy 
 intelligent well technology status opportunities developing marginal reserves spe point insert public accounts debate adoption fuel prices levels established international market 
 country major oil exporter conditions favorable adopting domestic prices different practiced international markets 
 hand depending conditions public accounts weight fuel subsidies relation tax revenue maintenance type policy questioned policy makers 
 depending difficulties associated adopt fuel subsidies could become clear society substantial costs incurred well benefits alternative allocation resources 
 coincidence saudi arabia studies reducing fuel subsidies represents important source government spending leads inefficient use fuel 
 recent years due growing demand electricity oil consumption thermoelectric generation grew substantially thus eliminating excessive amount oil could used increase export revenues 
 another conditional factor related structure petroleum industry 
 vertically integrated companies operating oil production refining activities becomes easier government adopt fuel price policy 
 reason company operates refining activity needs follow fuel prices policy determined government firm acquire oil input market price lead incur financial losses make necessary subsidies government way disincentive investments avoid extreme situations bankruptcy refineries 
 indeed firms vertically integrated whosale fuel prices set lower levels compared input prices acts like tax oil companies 
 companies vertically integrated government could benefit kind tax since refineries losses government depending situation called compensate losses 
 another factor may hinder adoption derivative prices prevailing abroad existence private refineries operating country since would accept operating losses even short term 
 private refineries reduce simply decide stop production derivatives order avoid incurring losses may cause depending participation private refineries total oil production domestic supply crisis 
 shall see later factor plays important role china since refineries known teapots represent significant portion refining capacity 
 finally one forget fuel type ends interfering countrys ability determine spread international prices visavis domestic 
 example general prices jet fuel different countries tend behave closer prevailing international market since possible conduct arbitration different international airports order minimize cost fuel acquisition 
 happen gasoline diesel tend purchased consumed country except regions near borders may significant differences specification fuels among countries may turn impossible arbitrage 
 comparing brazil china experiences adopting fuel prices policy 
 better understand various factors influence adoption policy fuel prices brazilian chinese experiences quite enlightening 
 one hand needs adopt pricing policy present countries objective conditions enable adoption policy greater restrictions china brazil 
 historical background fuel price policy brazil brazil oil industry came strong state presence 
 publication decreelaw created national fuel department dnc ministry infrastructure aiming promote development national production 
 decree oil declared public utility since state took major role formation fuel prices brazil lameiras giambiagi 
 petrobras created state enterprise monopoly exploration production transportation refining oil oil products 
 however cnp retained supervisory powers petroleum sector 
 period exrefinery prices petroleum products based cost imported oil single tax customs port charges 
 however since enactment law 
 pricing criteria modified 
 established exrefinery price per unit excluding single tax tabulated petroleum products produced country set periodically cnp multiplying coefficients 
 average cif cost national currency per unit volume crude oil imported previous quarter art 
 emphasized aviation fuels tax exemptions maintained provided law 
 demonstrated governments intention past encourage development incipient civil aviation industry 
 thus cnp power increase coefficients thus lead increases prices petroleum products order provide necessary resources petrobras implement investment program 
 moreover exrefinery prices added parcels called points corresponded tax disguise obtain price realization 
 adding distribution retail margins obtain retail price consumers 
 another change formula calculating prices petroleum products average price realization refinery going calculated sum four categories unit costs costs related international prices crude oil materials imported consumer whose values also varied depending exchange rate costs related personnel costs variable costs determined according conjuncture domestic prices cover expenses depreciation amortization ensure return capital invested 
 according barbosa changes justified based following arguments convenience prices petroleum products formed basis production costs domestic market structure foreign trade need ensure refinery profitability operations need become explicit fiscal protection given petroleum products order carry proper verification results refining operations thereby secure resources allocated exclusively petrobras investments 
 thus immediate postwar first oil shock period reasons adopting substantially different prices international market since world cheap oil moreover brazil heavily dependent imported oil 
 according baer increase imported oil prices higher domestic prices since government tried cushion oil shock dilute effects time 
 nevertheless brazilian financial system reform set series measures leading indexation economy oil shocks led increase inflation whose rates doubled thereafter began float 
 moreover increases oil prices dependence imported oil produced important implications brazilian trade balance 
 oil imports accounted total imports already accounted 
 second oil shock percentage reached helped push brazilian economy debt crisis fishlow 
 oil crisis brazilian authorities adopted measures reduce gasoline consumption raising gasoline prices higher derivatives compared increase prices diesel fuel oil respectively period implementation program proalcool goal creating substitute gasoline closing gas stations weekends way discouraging consumption araujo ghirardi 
 second oil shock sharp rise interest rates promoted chairman federal reserve fed paul volcker brazil entered debt crisis period ended exacerbating runaway inflation since government could longer anchor expectations economic agents controlling foreign exchange rate 
 period context accelerating price increases succession economic plans order stem inflation fuel prices public tariffs increase gap relation goods increased budget deficit constituting important source transfer public private sector carneiro 
 period prices petrol diesel example accumulated negative real growth 
 however according baer impacts price controls government shortterm effects since affected companies compensated financially government subsidies foreign loans fund investment program even cases cover operational costs 
 thus price controls translated later increasing public deficit intelligent well technology status opportunities developing marginal reserves spe exceeded certain limit inevitably led government raise fuel prices public tariffs resulting new surge inflation

 measures included release prices margins freight throughout production chain gradual elimination subsidies existing petroleum products changes tariff structure 
 important note although necessary implementation competition markets beneficial population removal cross subsidies fuel prices elimination freight subsidies led rise prices states 
 currently therefore neither anp governmental agency regulates form prices automotive fuels sold country 
 however fact majority petrobras massive presence production petroleum refining union main shareholder makes possible adopt fuel prices policy 
 effort overcome decades dependence imported oil brazil time significantly increased oil production process gained impetus breaking monopoly petrobras achieving selfsufficiency end last decade figure 
 discovery presalt reserves country become significant exporter oil ensure greater flexibility determination domestic fuel prices 
 however according almeida new condition may temptation leeway practice different prices international market authors vision quite dangerous standpoint national economy energy sector 
 production crude oil ngpl others liquids petroleum consumption brazil thousand barrels per day source eia doe current context rising oil prices international market brazil avoided increasing fuel prices due fears inflationary impacts since priority right create conditions reducing high interest rates alleviate public deficit create favorable environment increased investment rate 
 price rising anhydrous ethanol comprised gasoline gasoline prices increased substantially well caused strong dissatisfaction impacts inflation

 however outbreak serious international crisis october year well economic depression followed chinese authorities took advantage deflationary scenario establish policy readjustment fuel prices 
 policy three objectives establish prices better reflect domestic prices prevailing international market prevent refiners incurring losses avoid problems domestic supply 
 thus early announced prices gasoline diesel exrefinery would adjusted reference basket crude oils formed types oil brent dubai cinta bloomberg 
 addition petrochina said statement prices fuels also defined considering costs transportation processing taxes profit refinery activity 
 meanwhile resale taxes derivatives increased reaching rmb 
 yuan per liter gasoline rmb

 finally minimum prices resale retail fuels abolished allowed change prices within range plus less price reference set ndrc

 also said time government would provide subsidies farmers bus companies taxi drivers 
 words ndrc official statement time urgent need use price mechanisms way signal scarcity curbing excessive fast growth oil consumption 
 moreover recent experience indicated price suppression discouraged refiners produce import leading shortages products lines gas stations 
 fact price increase intended boost production smaller refineries known teapots 
 refineries according ndrc access supply crude oil leads segment purchase imported oil international prices consequently incur losses refining operation 
 see figure gasoline prices final consumers stood levels selected countries prices asian country already higher canada united states 
 due inflationary pressures chinese authorities prevented much variation international oil prices passed domestically 
 however cooling inflation recent escalation oil prices terms geopolitical uncertainties new sanctions iran ndrc imposing significant increases fuel prices last march two adjustments made signals authorities taking advantage opportunity bring prices closer prevailing international markets 
 new adjustments march resale gasoline price china exceeded united states 
 according analyst china securities investment jianyn rui dingkun prices germany france south korea japan relatively high compared prices china due higher tax burden fuel environmental protection policies severe 
 china sum tax profits large state enterprises ranging resale prices fuels figure gasoline retail pricesa selected countries china japan france united kingdom germany canada united states source iea eia doe los angeles times nbc news 
 prices represent retail prices including taxes regular unleaded gasoline except france united kingdom premium unleaded gasoline rd quarter 
 end march conclusions identified two factors hinders chinese governments control gasoline prices 
 first differently brazil petrobras owners refinery capacity china private refineries knows teapots represent around total refinery capacity depend imported petroleum purchases international prices could substantially bigger domestic prices 
 order assure domestic supply refined products chinese government obligated big three sinopec cnooc cnpc sell crude oil subsidized prices results losses enterprises 
 past state companies pressured government increase gasoline prices reducing production refineries resulting rationing problems major cities 
 second china depends increasingly imported petroleum purchased international prices governments decision way controlling gasoline prices level international prices must imply losses state companies 
 conversely brazil selfsufficient oil since well majority petroleum products refined domestically pricing policy adopted necessarily imply losses petrobras group since extraction refining costs higher domestic gasoline prices 
 easier brazilian government minimize impact higher international oil prices domestic prices oil products since measure imply supply problems neither absolute losses petrobras group 
 consequence brazilian government define gasoline prices moments higher others international prices 
 petrobras monopolistic condition many markets jet fuel natural gas company inflate prices reduce possible losses incurred gasoline diesel lgp cylinders kg residential consumers historically last sold highly subsidized rates 
 intelligent well technology status opportunities developing marginal reserves spe however china reducing share private sector refining activity considered authorities inefficient growing dependence imported oil make difficult sustain prices prevailing international market long term 
 one solution found resort longterm contracts supply provisions prevent immediate transfer variations spot market 
 however contracts supply longterm oil still represent small percentage imported oil pressures automatic alignment pricing increase short term particularly scenery continuing inflation pressures
