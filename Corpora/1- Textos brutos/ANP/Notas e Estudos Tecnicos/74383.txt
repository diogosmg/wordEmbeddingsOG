I - Overview 

 

Since  the  end  of  the  1990’s  there  is  no  formal  government  interference  in  the  production  of 
automotive  fuels  and  nor  at  their  prices  in  Brazil.  During  this  decade,  the  Brazilian  government 
implemented several structural and legal changes in different industries, including oil and gas. Those 
changes were part of a comprehensive State reform and intended to change the mechanisms directing 
state  participation  in  the  economic  life  of  the  Brazilian  society.  Specifically  in  the  oil  industry,  the 
flexibilization  of  the  state  monopoly  in  1995  (allowing  companies  other  than  Petrobras  to  operate 
through  concession  contracts  or  state  permissions)  was  followed  by  several  small  changes  that 
culminated with the beginning of the liberalization of automotive fuel prices in 1996, the creation of a 
regulatory  agency  in  1998  and  the  absence  of  any  kind  of  official  control  over  fuel  prices  in  Brazil 
since January 2001 (when the liberalization process was completed). 

 Nevertheless, given the extensive market share of Petrobras (a private company in which the 
Brazilian  government  is  the  majority  shareholder),  fossil-based  automotive  fuel  prices  have 
maintained  considerable  stability  over  time.  This  (unofficial)  policy  is  consistent  with  the 
government’s objective of price stability, but contrasts sharply with the oscillation of prices occurring 
in the international oil and oil-products markets. In 2011, however, consumer gasoline prices in Brazil 
followed an atypical pattern, due, essentially to the behavior of supply and demand for ethanol in the 
country due to the extensive Brazilian flex fuel fleet  

In  this  article  we  argue  that  although  the  Brazilian  gasoline  market  does  not  reflect 
international price movements, the international market for sugar and ethanol plays a significant role 
in the definition of prices and quantities of those products in the domestic Brazilian market. Several 
companies  (other  than  Petrobras)  are  present  in  both  the  production  and  commercialization  of  sugar 
cane,  sugar  and  ethanol  in  Brazil  and,  therefore,  the  Brazilian  government  has  much  less  room  for 
intervention both in the prices established by economic agents in those sectors, and the quantities they 
offer, when compared to the oil-derived fuel market. With the increasing share of Otto-cycle flex-fuel 
vehicles  in  the  Brazilian  fleet  and  the  mandatory  mix  of  ethanol  in  the  gasoline  sold  to  final 
consumers, we believe that ethanol will be an ever-greater complicating factor in the maintenance of 
internal price stability for automotive gasoline.  

 
 

II - Gasoline and ethanol fuel markets in Brazil. 

 

The  Brazilian  oil  industry  has  been  traditionally  characterized  by  a  strong  presence  (and 
interference)  of  the  government  on  its  activities.  Until  1995,  the  Brazilian  government  had  a 
constitutional monopoly in exploration, production, importation, refining and transportation of oil and 
its  derivatives  and  operated  directly  on  these  sectors  through  the  state  company  Petroleo  Brasileiro 
S.A.  (Petrobras).  Although  the  distribution  and  retail  sales  of  automotive  fuels  were  not  state 
monopolies,  they  also  suffered  from  a  strong  state  intervention,  which  operated  through  several 
controls on prices, sales margins and freight costs.  

Fuel prices control  was, until the beginning of  the 1990´s, an instrument used by the Brazilian 
government not only for energy policy purposes, but also mainly to control rising inflation rates and 
its impact on the economy.

As  Souza  e  Silva  (2003)1  points  out,  until  de  90’s,  the  strategic  management  of  Petrobras 
regarding oil products pricing, goods and services purchases policy and  R&D  was determined in an 
environment  in  which  sectoral  goals  were  always  lined  up  with  macroeconomic  objectives.  The 
organization of the oil industry into a state monopoly made possible attempts to maintain consistency 
in those goals. 

In  the  1990´s,  however,  the  Brazilian  government  implemented  several  structural  and  legal 
changes  in  different  industries,  including  oil  and  gas.  Those  changes  were  part  of  a  comprehensive 
State reform and intended to change the mechanisms directing state participation in the economic life 
of  the  Brazilian  society.  Specifically  in  the  oil  industry,  the  flexibilization  of  the  state  monopoly  in 
1995  (allowing  companies  other  than  Petrobras  to  operate  through  concession  contracts  or  state 
permissions)  was  followed  by  several  small  changes  that  culminated  with  the  beginning  of  the 
liberalization of automotive  fuel prices in 1996, the creation of a regulatory agency in 1998 and the 
absence  of  any  kind  of  official  control  over  fuel  prices  in  Brazil  since  January  2001  (when  the 
liberalization process was completed). 

The  main  justification  for  the  changes  was  that  the  government  had  failed  in  effectively 
managing these sectors and it was necessary to change the way the Brazilian State participated in the 
economic life of Brazilian society. In this context, Law n. 8.884/94 was promulgated, in 1994, as part 
of the new Brazilian antitrust policy2, and the state intervention was reduced (in 1995) so as to enable 
companies  other  than  Petrobras  to  participate  in  all  segments  of  the  oil  production  chain.  Law  n. 
9.478/1997 set out the basic principles governing the activities of the oil, oil products and natural gas 
industries 3 (ANP, 2002).  

This law created the National Petroleum Agency (Agência Nacional do Petróleo - ANP)4, whose 
main  goal  was  to  regulate,  contract  and  monitor  all  the  activities  inherent  to  the  oil,  oil  products, 
natural gas and biofuel industries in Brazil.5 Under this new regulatory scheme, automotive fuels price 
controls,  that  had  begun  being  abolished  in  1996,  were  definitely  abandoned,  a  process  that  was 
concluded in January 2002. From that point onwards no government body, regulates in any  way  the 
price of automotive fuel sold on the Brazilian market, nor the quantity offered.  

Until  late  2001,  the  domestic  supply  of  fuel  in  the  country  presented  itself  structured  into 
segments that worked separated in specialized functions. For the rules in place so far, only Petrobras 
was authorized to import gasoline and diesel (imports of other oil products had already been released, 
although  it  required  prior  approval  of  ANP).  The  distributors  could  only  acquire  automotive  fuels 
from oil refineries and/or petrochemical plants. In December 2001, ANP published several ordinances 
that  rearranged  the  downstream  institutional  environment  in  Brazil,  changes  that  were  intended  to 
promote new supply options to distributors and consumers. 

One  of  the  guiding  principles  of  the  broad  legal  and  institutional  reform  implemented  in  the 
hydrocarbon industry (of  which the process of liberalization of fuel prices  was a part) was therefore 
the  introduction  of  competition  in  the  fuel  sector.  In  order  for  this  to  occur  in  the  most  effective 
manner  it  was  necessary  to  eliminate  institutional  barriers  to  entry  of  new  players  on  to  the  market 
(Baran; Bicalho; et all, 2010)6. The introduction of competition on to the markets is not an end unto 
itself however. The main justification for promoting a competitive market is the fact that competition

encourages companies to be efficient and to offer a greater variety of products and services at lower 
prices. In a competitive market economy, price signals tend to be free of distortion and they generate 
incentives  for  companies  to  re-direct  lower  utility  resources  towards  ends  which  have  greater 
aggregate  value.  De-centralized  decision-making  by  the  companies  promotes  the  efficient  allocation 
of  scarce  resources,  which  belong  to  society.  It  also  increases  consumer  well  being  in  addition  to 
accelerating  progress  and  technical  innovation  (OECD,  2002)7.  As  such,  the  search  for  a  greater 
degree of competitiveness in the oil and gas industry is, in the final analysis, aimed at maximizing the 
benefit to society of the result of the activities in these industries.  

In  automotive  fuels  distribution  and  commercialization,  the  regulatory  changes  envisioned 
competitive  pressures  through  two  different  mechanisms:  imports  or  local  production  (by  other 
companies). In a scenario of free prices and import, it might be expected that the price of petroleum-
derived  automotive  fuels  in  Brazil  would  follow  the  trends  observed  on  the  international  market, 
given the possibility of arbitrage. Comparison of gasoline prices in Brazil and in foreign markets from 
2001 onwards demonstrates significantly different trends, with prices on the internal Brazilian market 
being  considerably  stable  over  long  periods  of  time,  despite  variations  in  foreign  market  prices  (see 
Graph 1, below).  

Broadly speaking, the reason behind this market behavior is that although the Brazilian State has 
eased its monopoly over the oil and oil derivative industry and has ceased to intervene in pricing by 
means of indexing the price of oil products, it still controls Petrobras. The Brazilian State is the major 
shareholder in Petrobras and is therefore able to direct that the company follow a pricing policy that is 
consistent  with  government  macroeconomic  aims  of  price  stability  and  low  inflation.    Furthermore, 
even though the 1995 legislation permitted other companies to operate in the fields of oil refining and 
fuel import, these segments remain largely concentrated in the hands of Petrobras. In 2011 Petrobras 
held  98%  of  the  country’s  refining  capacity  and  was  constructing  a  further  3  refineries.  In  terms  of 
traded  volume,  Petrobras  accounted  for  over  95%  of  production  stage  gasoline  sales  (refineries) 
between  2008  and  2011.  This  data  demonstrates  that,  although  automotive  fuel  prices  are  not 
officially  set  in  Brazil,  Petrobras  does  have  significant  market  power  to  define  the  price  levels  of 
gasoline  and  other  fossil-based  automotive  fuels  in  the  country,  as  it  practically  controls  the 
refine/import stage of gasoline production chain.  It must be observed that gasoline prices behavior in 
2011  were  due  (as  will  be  discussed  later  in  this  paper)  to  fuel  ethanol  prices  (not  controlled  by 
Petrobras).  Nonetheless,  Petrobras’  lack  of  capacity  to  sustain  a  stable  price  trajectory  can  be 
explained (mainly) by ethanol markets structure. 

One  should  keep  in  mind  that  gasoline  and  ethanol  prices  carry  significant  weight  in  the 
country’s  main  inflation  index  (the  National  Consumer  Price  Index  -  Índice  Nacional  de  Preços  ao 
Consumidor  -  INPC)  and  that  control  over  fuel  prices  in  the  country  has  historically  been  an 
instrument used by the government to control inflation and its impacts on the economy. Accordingly, 
it  should  be  observed  that  following  the  liberalization  of  fuel  prices  in  Brazil  the  government 
introduced  a  social  contribution  tax  –  the  Contribution  to  Intervention  in  the  Economic  Domain  - 
Contribuição de Intervenção no Domínio Econômico (CIDE), and amongst its goals were serving as a 
buffer for possible fuel price variation in the country. In recent years, increases and decreases in the 
production cost of gasoline have been set off in whole or in part by respective increases or decreases 
in the CIDE8 so that the impact on the  final consumer of the variation in refinery prices tends to be 
minimal or non-existent.  

In  direct  contrast,  the  production  prices  of  ethanol  have,  historically,  been  subject  to  seasonal 
variation in line with sugarcane harvests and intercrop periods. These price trends influence prices in 
the  subsequent  stages  of  the  productive  chain  (distribution  and  resale)  and  there  is  therefore  a  great 
variability in  the resale prices for ethanol throughout  the  year. In this sense it  should be highlighted

measure was to set off, for the consumer, increases in the price of gasoline at refineries.

Despite 

lower  market  concentration 

fuels  distribution  and 
commercialization Brazilian markets, it could still be identified, up to 2011, a low price variability in 
gasoline prices, that were strongly influenced by the stability in refining prices. The second half of the 
2000s,  nevertheless,  has  witnessed  a  major  structural  change  in  the  market  for  automotive  fuels  in 
Brazil: the appearance and growth of a significant flex fuel that lead the ethanol market to bear more 
influence into the gasoline market, a move not anticipated by the government that has undermined the 
ability  of  Petrobras  to  keep  track  of  both  products  prices  (since  it  is  no  longer  enough  to  control 
gasoline production and imports to control the products prices). 

Another  important  distinction  between  the  ethanol  and  the  gasoline  market  relates  to  the 
regulation of their respective value chains. As already stated above, regulation of the entire gasoline 
chain  of  production  has  been  within  the  competence  of  the  ANP  since  1997.  The  regulation  of  the 
value  chain  of  ethanol  fuel  was,  until  the  issue  of  Provisional  Measure  n°  532,  on  April  28,  2011, 
shared  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Farming  and  Supply  - Ministério da Agricultura, Pecuária e 
Abastecimento (MAPA) and the ANP. MAPA was the body with legal competence over the industry 
up until end of the production of ethanol fuel stage, and the ANP took over to with the beginning of 
the fuel distribution stage. The reasoning behind this division of competence was that ethanol was a 
product derived from sugarcane and not petroleum, so that it was not for the ANP to have competence 
over  the  production  stage  of  the  chain.  The  fact  is  that  not  all  raw  material  at  a  sugarcane  plant  is 
converted  into  ethanol  fuel,  in  that  it  can  also  be  converted  into  products  that  are  essentially 
foodstuffs.   

The  change  in  the  regulatory  regime  applicable  to  ethanol  fuel  was  only  consolidated  with  the 
conversion of Provisional Measure n° 532 into Law 14.490 in April 2011. With the introduction of the 
new law, the ANP commenced a wide-ranging process of edition and revision of a series of norms, in 
order to align the ethanol production segment with the new legal provisions. This process has proved 
to be a major challenge for the regulator, given the scale of its new attributes, which include the duty 
to guarantee the supply of ethanol fuel throughout national territory as well as that of authorizing and 
monitoring  a  significant  amount  of  ethanol  plants.  The  challenge  becomes  even  greater  when  we 
consider  that  this  legal  change  occurred  in  a  context  in  which  the  internal  supply  of  ethanol  was 
encountering  serious  difficulties  and  also  the  regulatory  body  was  seeking  to  assist  with  the 
government’s cost-cutting policies by reducing expenditure and freezing the hiring of new staff.  

Finally, the seasonality typical to agricultural products (such as sugarcane) means that the price 
of ethanol fuel becomes the focus of debate on an annual basis. This is due to the combined effect of 
intercrop periods in sugar cane cultivation (said periods that naturally promote a seasonal increase in 
the  price  of  ethanol)  together  with  the  trend  of  increased  demand  for  ethanol  on  both  internal  and 
external  markets  and  the  realignment  of  prices  as  the  result  of  government  measures  to  combat  tax 
evasion. These measures include the marking of ethanol fuel with colorants. The combined effect of 
these factors exerts pressure on the price of ethanol fuel for the consumer.  

Thus, even though these variations in prices, common to agricultural produce, are seasonal and 
foreseeable,  they  affect  the  final  consumer,  in  that  consumers  do  not  have  seasonal  income  nor  are 
they able to stockpile products for individual consumption. In the years prior to 2010, consumers had 
access  to  the  product  at  low  cost  whilst  during  intercrop  periods  the  increase  in  prices  had  the 
potential to restrict consumption. As we shall see below, from 2011 onwards the market conditions for 
the  product  changed  in  such  a  way  as  to  increase  ethanol  prices  to  levels  above  those  expected  by 
society and which impacted significantly on the final price of gasoline C to the final consumer.  

In parallel with the effect of seasonality which is typical of the sale of agricultural products and 
which  naturally  pressures  ethanol  fuel  prices  upwards  during  sugarcane  intercrop  periods,  the 
increasing  internal  demand  for  hydrated  ethanol  as  a  result  of  the  increase  in  the  fleet  of  biofuel 
vehicles has introduced an additional element of pressure on fuel prices. This has major potential for 
generating instability in gasoline C prices in the country.   

In the first quarter of 2011, gasoline prices at resale points began to increase significantly. This 
was not due to any alteration in the prices charged by Petrobras at the fuel production stage (refinery). 
It  was,  rather,  due  to  factors  related  to  the  increase  in  the  price  of  ethanol  fuel.  The  increase  in  the 
price  of  ethanol  fuel  on  the  Brazilian  market  was,  in  turn,  the  consequence  of  the  restriction  in  the 

5 

 

internal offer of the product. This restriction was a result both of the increase in the price of sugar on 
the  international  market,  which  led  ethanol  producers  to  direct  the  greater  share  of  their  sugarcane 
production to sugar rather than ethanol, and also of the reduction  in previous  years in investment in 
the productivity of sugar-cane fields. Both behaviors will be better discussed in the next section. 

 

III - Gasoline price behavior in 2011 

 
Historically,  relevant  increases  in  the  price  of  distribution  of  common  gasoline  observed  in 
competitive markets could be correlated to increases in the price of gasoline A at refineries. The latter 
prices  did  not,  in  general,  present  the  volatility  observed  in  the  international  market,  as  can  be  seen 
from Graph 1.

On  the  other  hand,  as  it  is  illustrated  in  Graph  2,  ethanol  fuel  prices  have  traditionally  shown 
significant variance, which could almost entirely be attributed to seasonality of sugar-cane production 
and/or the impact of sugar price behavior in the international market.

Bearing in mind the correlation and the stability in the prices charged by producers of gasoline 
A, the significant increase in the price of gasoline C as from the second bimester of 2011 took society 
by surprise.  

Graph 3, below, sets out the evolution of the average price of gasoline on the Brazilian market 
between January 2010 and May 2011, on the basis of the prices charged by the producers of gasoline 
A  and  on  the  prices  of  gasoline  C  in  the  stages  of  distribution  and  resale9.  On  the  basis  of  this 
observation  we  can  perceive  major  stability  in  average  prices  in  the  country  between  January  2010 
and January 2011. From mid-February 2011 onwards there was a sharp increase in the price of fuel in 
the distribution and resale stages. This was not a consequence of the behavior of average gasoline A 
prices at the production/import stages, in that these prices  remained  stable throughout  the period set 
out in the graph.

Between February and April 2011, average resale prices in Brazil increased around 11%, whilst 
average distribution prices grew by approximately 9%. As can be seen in Graph 3, from mid-March 
2011  onwards,  the  prices  of  resale  and  distribution  of  common  gasoline  in  the  country  followed  a 
pattern of increase which cannot be explained by the conduct of the prices of gasoline A in Brazil. 

Bearing  in  mind  that,  in  addition  to  gasoline  A,  the  two  major  elements  that  influence  the 
composition  of  the  prices  of  common  gasoline  are  the  taxes  levied  and  the  price  of  anhydrous 
ethanol10, and that there was no variation in the tax payable on the distribution and resale of common 
gasoline,  it  is  necessary  to  analyze  the  behavior  of  the  price  of  anhydrous  ethanol  fuel  (added  to 
gasoline A in the proportion of 25% in order to make up gasoline C) as well as the price of hydrated 
ethanol, the principal substitute for gasoline C on the automotive fuel resale markets. We need to do 
this in order to identify the factors that led to the significant increase in the prices of gasoline C from 
mid-March 2011 onwards.  

Some  clarifications  are  called  for  prior  to  the  analysis  of  the  factors  that  explain  the  behavior 
presented  by  the  price  of  gasoline  C  in  the  first  quarter  of  2011.  Firstly,  the  characteristics  of  price 
volatility  associated  with  agricultural  seasonality  are  inherent  to  the  ethanol  fuel  market:  given  that 
this  product  is  derived  from  sugarcane,  its  price  is  substantially  influenced  by  harvest  and  intercrop 
periods in the producing regions11.   

Given that Brazilian ethanol fuel is a product derived from sugarcane, its raw material is subject 
to the seasonal factors inherent to agricultural production. As can be seen in Graph 2, historically, the 
price of ethanol has risen in the sugarcane intercrop period (between November and May) as a normal 
consequence of market behavior and independently of any diversion towards the production of sugar

http://www.anp.gov.br/?pg=41230&m=&t1=&t2=&t3=&t4=&ar=&ps=&cachebust=1306433624856  
11 To this effect it is worth noting that the production of ethanol is distributed between two major regions in Brazil: 
the  Center-South  region,  represented  basically  by  the  state  of  São  Paulo,  and  the  North-North-Eastern  regions 
represented by the states of Alagoas and Pernambuco. The first region, in the last harvest, accounted for 89% of the 
area  harvested  for  sugarcane  (according  to  data  from  CONAB,  available  in  www.conab.gov.br).  The  harvest  and 
intercrop periods are however different in both regions. In the Center-South region the sugar cane harvests begin in 
April/May  and  end  in  November/December.  In  the  North-North-Eastern  region,  however,  the  harvest  period 
commences  in  September/October  and  ends  in  February/March.  Bearing  in  mind  the  significant  share  in  national 
production of the Center-South region, this study, in referring to ethanol harvest and intercrop periods refers to those 
corresponding to the Center-South region.

inherent  albeit  that  this  shift  in  price  may  be  accentuated  in  years  of  price  hikes  for  sugar  on  the 
international market, with producers opting to expand their production of sugar.  

Ethanol  prices  may  be  influenced  not  only  by  the  variations  in  offer  arising  out  of  seasonal 
factors in the production of sugarcane but also by the prices of products which are alternatives to it (in 
terms of offer, sugar and alcohol directed to other purposes than fuel; in terms of demand, gasoline).  

Whilst both the production and prices of ethanol have seasonal behavior in line with sugarcane 
harvests  there  is  no  proportional  response  in  demand  for  the  product.  In  fact  demand  may,  during 
some  months,  respond  in  a  contra  -  cyclical  manner  (with  demand  increasing  in  intercrop  periods) 
which sometimes intensifies the trend of price increases already present during intercrops.  

Before  the  introduction  of  biofuel  (flex  fuel)  cars  onto  the  Brazilian  market,  the  only  response 
open  to  consumers  in  the  face  of  hikes  in  the  prices  of  hydrated  ethanol  was  to  reduce  the  use  of 
automotive  vehicles.  In  fact,  it  can  be  reasonably  presumed  that  the  consumers  would,  at  least 
partially,  maintain  their  pattern  of  demand  for  ethanol,  in  line  with  established  habits,  rather  than 
opting  to  use  other  forms  of  transport.  Consumers  therefore  ended  up  incorporating  the  increase  in 
prices into their budgets.  

With  the  advent  of  biofuel  cars  (flex  fuel)  the  possibility  afforded  to  drivers  of  cars  with  this 
technology to switch between gasoline C and hydrated ethanol fuel became an option exercised at the 
time  of  filling  the  tank  and  based  on  the  individual  preferences  of  each  consumer  and  the  relation 
between  the  prices  of  both  fuels12.  As  the  share  of  flex  cars  in  the  national  passenger  car  fleet 
increased,  a  greater  degree  of  interrelationship  was  observed  between  the  markets  for  both  fuels  in 
other  words,  the  variation  of  prices  in  one  market  began  to  have  more  direct  and  immediate 
repercussions in demand of the other.   

The comprehension of the factors which led to the behavior observed in the markets for common 
gasoline in the first semester of 2011 requires analysis not  only of the evolution of the price of said 
common  gasoline  in  Brazil  during  this  period  but  also  of  the  scale  of  the  broadening  of 
interdependence  between  the  markets  of  gasoline  and  ethanol,  as  well  as  of  the  impacts  of  the 
variations  in  the  ethanol  market  of  the  prices  charged  on  the  markets  for  distribution  and  resale  of 
gasoline C and the conditions production and offer of ethanol in the scenario of growing demand.  

It  should  also  be  noted  that  the  interdependence  between  the  gasoline  and  ethanol  markets  is 
more  easily  perceived  in  those  markets  in  which,  during  harvest  periods,  the  competitiveness  of 
ethanol  in  relation  to  gasoline  tends  to  be  very  high,  given  both  the  proximity  of  the  centers  of 
production. Bearing in mind, therefore, that the Center-South region is the main producing region of 
ethanol  and  that  the  state  of  São  Paulo  is  not  only  the  major  producer  but  also  the  main  center  of 
consumption  of  ethanol  (hydrous  and  anhydrous)  13,  the  behavior  observed  in  this  unit  of  the 
federation may be considered a representative example with which to explain the oscillation in prices 
and  demand  for  fuels.  We  shall  thus  turn  to  an  examination  of  these  variables  in  the  state  of  São 
Paulo.  

 

IV - Main causes of increases in the prices of gasoline C observed in the first semester of 2011 

 
Having set out the above considerations we now turn to an examination of the evolution of the 

prices of resale and distribution of gasoline C and hydrated ethanol in the country: 

 
 

                                                           
12 The fuels, despite being good substitutes for each other, have distinct charcateristics. One of these characterisitcs in 
particular  determines  the  economic  advantage  for  the  consumer  of  substitution  of  the  fuels:  hydrated  ethanol  has 
lower  calorific  power  compared  to  gasoline.  It  is  only  economically  advantageous  to  the  consumer  to  fill  up  with 
EHC when it is priced at 70% or less than the price of gasoline. The difference between the calorific power of both 
types of fuel is directly reflected in the per kilometer yield of both.  
13  The  state  of  São  Paulo,  in  2010,  accounted  for  58%  of  the  sugarcane  harvested  in  Brazil  and  57%  of  the  total 
production of ethanol (according to data from CONAB) and for 25% of the total sales of gasoline C and 56% of the 
total sales of hydrated ethanol in the country, according to sales data from the ANP.

As can be seen from Graph 4, up until January 2006, a gasoline C and hydrated ethanol followed 
trajectories  of  increases  in  average  resale  prices.  From  May  2006  onwards,  the  average  prices  of 
gasoline  C  presented  reasonably  stable  behavior,  whilst  those  of  ethanol  oscillated  throughout  the 
year, principally in line with the offer available during sugarcane harvest and intercrop periods. Note 
the  ethanol  price  hikes  which  occurred  in  March  2006  and  February  2010,  when  average  prices 
reached a level of almost R$2.00/l. 

In 2011, price dynamics changed and the trend that had been noted in early 2010, with a small 
increase in gasoline C prices (2.56% between December 2009 and February 2010) in response to the 
increase of 15.09% in the prices of hydrated ethanol, came back with greater intensity in 2011. 

Economic  theory  teaches  us  that  in  free  markets,  the  main  forces  for  price  increases  generally 
arise  out  of  pressure  from  demand  or  pressure  from  costs14.  Pressures  from  demand  are,  in  general 
characterized by an excess of demand in relation to offer, in a given period of time. This may occur 
for a variety of reasons (increase in disposable income, public policies stimulating demand, change in 
consumption  patterns  of  the  population,  etc).  Pressure  on  costs,  on  the  other  hand,  is  characterized 
principally  by  increases  in  the  costs  of  raw  materials  and  other  business  costs  (increase  in  interest 
rates, currency devaluation, increase in labor costs etc.) As indicated in Graph 3, any pressure related 
to  the  price  of  the  principal  raw  material  (gasoline  A  at  the  production  units)  can  be  discarded  as  a 
determining factor in the price of Gasoline C.  It is however necessary to examine the other possible 
root  causes  of  increase  in  the  price  of  common  gasoline  so  as  then  to  determine  the  reasons  for  the 
atypical behavior encountered in the first quarter of 2011.  

In  relation  to  the  pressures  of  demand,  the  consumption  of  common  gasoline  in  São  Paulo 
decreased progressively from 2008 onwards, as can be seen from Graph 5, below, whilst the prices of 
hydrated  ethanol  presented  consecutive  increases.  Even  with  the  increases  in  the  prices  of  hydrated 
ethanol in the early months of each year, the trend continued to be one of increase in the demand for 
ethanol and retraction of the demand for common gasoline.  

 

 
 
 
 
 

                                                           
14  There  is  also  an  inertia  component,  associated,  in  general,  with  economic  indexation  mechanisms  and  the 
expectations of private agents – but it is not relevant for the persente analysis.

Anhydrous Ethanol

Hydrated Ethanol

 

Source: Drawn up by the author on the basis of data from data from CEPEA/ESALQ/USP 

 
As  Graph  6  indicates,  from  February  2011  onwards,  both  the  price  of  anhydrous  ethanol  and 
hydrated  ethanol  followed  relatively  similar  ascendant  trajectories  until  March.  From  the  second 
fortnight  in  March/2011  onwards,  there  is  a  shift  in  the  variation  trajectories  of  both  products. 
Anhydrous ethanol  was subject to repeated increases  until  it reached a peak of de  R$ 2.75/l, in  mid 
April/11.  The  prices  of  hydrated  ethanol  presented  a  decline  albeit  that  they  only  returned  to  their 
early January/11 levels in the second fortnight in April. 

Taking into account the addition of 25% of anhydrous ethanol to gasoline A in the composition 
of  gasoline  C,  significant  price  increases  in  anhydrous  ethanol  would,  to  some  extent,  give  rise  to 
pressure  for  the  readjustment  of  the  prices  of  common  gasoline.  In  previous  years,  the  prices  of 
anhydrous ethanol, despite presenting seasonal variations, did not increase sufficiently to give rise to 
significant alterations in the distribution and resale prices of gasoline C – as occurred in 2011. 

The increase in the demand for gasoline C as a result of the migration of consumers of hydrated 
ethanol to gasoline C, particularly in the state of São Paulo, in a scenario of restriction of the supply of 
ethanol,  pressured  the  demand  for  anhydrous  ethanol.  The  consequence  of  this  was  the  increase  of 
75.77%  in  these  prices  at  the  production  units  between  the  second  week  of  March/2011,  and  the 
second  week  of  April/2011.  This  generated  impacts  in  the  final  price  of  gasoline.  In  the  period 
between the first week of January/2011 and the last week of April 2011, the increase in prices for the 
average final consumer of gasoline C was 12.18% for the state of São Paulo and 8.36% in Brazil.  

Having made these considerations it is clear that the main motives for the increase in the average 
price  of  common  gasoline  in  the  country  were  the  behaviors  observed  in  the  ethanol  market.  We 
therefore  need  to  examine  the  dynamics  of  this  market  in  the  search  for  further  bases  for 
comprehension of the evolution of the prices of common gasoline.  

 

VI - The behavior of ethanol prices and their impact on the distribution and resale markets of 
common gasoline.  

 
Note  that  there  are  two  mechanisms  which  impact  on  the  variation  of  the  price  of  ethanol 
blended in gasoline currently sold in Brazil. The first of such mechanisms is the consequence of the 
introduction of biofuel (flex fuel) cars into the fleet of light vehicles, in 2003. The cars that have flex 
fuel  technology  can  operate  with  a  blend  of  gasoline  and  hydrated  ethanol  fuel  (EHC)  in  any 

 

12 

proportion  or  with  100%  of  one  or  the  other.  As  such,  hydrated  ethanol  became  the  principal 
substitute for gasoline. Motorists were then able to choose between the two fuels at the time of filling 
up, based on personal preference and on a comparison between the prices of both fuels.  It should be 
reminded that due to the fact that hydrated ethanol has lower calorific power than gasoline, it is only 
economically advantageous to the consumer to fill up with EHC when it is priced at 70% or less than 
the price of gasoline.  

As  the  share  of  flex  fuel  vehicles  in  the  national  fleet  of  passenger  cars  increased,  a  greater 
degree  of  interrelationship  has  been  verified  between  the  markets  of  both  fuels.  In  other  words,  the 
variation of prices in one market now has increasingly direct and immediate repercussions on demand 
in the other. In 2003, only 2.65% of the total number of cars produced in the country ran on biofuels. 
This percentage rose to around 86% of national production in 200915 and 84% of the total of licensed 
vehicles in the first quarter of 201116.  

The significant increase in the share of flex fuel vehicles in the national passenger vehicle fleet 
has  increased  significantly  since  2003  leading  to  a  substantial  increase  in  the  demand  for  hydrated 
ethanol  in  the  country.  In  2010,  EHC  consumption  was  15  million  m3  corresponding  to  50%  of  the 
consumption  of  gasoline.  This  demonstrates  that  gasoline  is  the  main  fuel  purchased  to  power  light 
vehicles. Analysis of the consumption of EHC and gasoline in the state of São Paulo, however, shows 
that,  during  the  same  period  (2010)  the  consumption  of  EHC  was  8.3  million  m3,  whilst  that  of 
gasoline  was  7.4  million  m3.  In  other  words,  the  consumption  of  EHC  was  greater  than  that  of 
gasoline  in  the  state.  This  data  is  significant  in  that  the  state  of  São  Paulo  has  the  country’s  largest 
fleet  of  vehicles.  Furthermore,  as  we  shall  see  later,  the  migration  of  a  substantial  portion  of  EHC 
consumers in the state to gasoline, as a result of the increase in ethanol prices, was one of the factors 
responsible for the significant increase in the final gasoline price in the first semester of 2011.   

The  second  mechanism  via  which  variations  in  the  price  of  ethanol  can  impact  on  the  price  of 
gasoline sold to the consumer arises from the fact that all gasoline sold to the final consumer in Brazil 
currently contains 20% of anhydrous ethanol in its composition. It  should also be observed that  this 
percentage  is  not  fixed  and  can  vary  from  18  to  25%  in  accordance  with  the  determinations  of  the 
Ministry of Agriculture. The gasoline sold to the final consumer in Brazil is therefore a blend of pure 
gasoline, called gasoline A, with anhydrous ethanol, and is known as gasoline C.  

As  the  possibility  of  substitution  of  the  demand  leads  to  interdependence  of  the  markets  of 
gasoline and ethanol at the distribution and resale  stages, the agents  who operated in the production 
markets  of  ethanol  and  sugar  are  aware  of  and  monitor  this  interdependence.  As  such,  one  factor 
which influences the prices of ethanol (anhydrous and hydrated) are the prices paid for the supply of 
said products to markets other than fuel (notably sugar and alcohol destined for non-automotive ends). 
This occurs not only because the products have the same raw material (sugar cane) but also because 
they  have similar production processes. Other factors  which explain the behavior of these prices are 
the decisions taken by producers in relation to the production volumes of anhydrous ethanol, hydrated 
ethanol, alcohol for non-automotive use, and sugar, in the light of the operational conditions of each 
productive unit and climate variables.  

As can be seen in Graph 8, which sets out the evolution of monthly production prices of hydrated 
ethanol  fuel  and  anhydrous  ethanol  fuel  between  2000  and  2011, price  variations  of  EAC  and  EHC 
followed  trajectories  that  were  relatively  similar  between  2000  and  2010.  However,  as  from  the 
beginning of 2011, there is an alteration in this behavior pattern with the shifting of price trajectory of

In  observing  Graph  8,  it  can  be  noted  that  the  average  production  price  of  anhydrous  ethanol 
attained R$ 2.726/l, in the third week of April, which represented an increase of 119% in relation to 
January  de  2011.  In  this  same  period,  the  increase  in  the  average  price  of  hydrated  ethanol  was 
30.65%, reaching a maximum total of R$ 1.632/l in the third week of March 2011. It is therefore clear 
that the movement of these prices was atypical and the increments were significantly differentiated.  

In particular the average price of anhydrous ethanol outstripped, in mid- April 2011,the weekly 
average  distribution  prices  of  common  gasoline  (a  behavior  that  had  not  been  observed  in  previous 
years), as is illustrated in Graph 9, below.

production, on the other hand, registered an increase of 7.8% in relation to the same period. This shift 
reduced  the  supply  of  ethanol  fuel  to  the  market.  Additionally,  bad  weather  conditions  in  the  first 
months  of  2011  also  contributed  to  reduce  the  supply  and  the  yield  of  sugar  cane  in  the  Brazilian 
market.  

Traditionally,  when  there  are  price  increases  for  ethanol  in  the  intercrop  periods  there  are 
economic  incentives  for  the  sugarcane  producers  to  bring  forward  the  harvest,  in  other  words  to 
beginning  harvesting  the  cane  before  the  programmed  period  so  as  to  make  the  most  of  the  price 
increases. The impact of bringing forward the harvest on prices in previous years generally began to 
be felt between  mid- February and March,  when prices entered into a trajectory of decline. In 2011, 
however,  heavy  rains  affected  the  main  production  regions  in  the  Center  South  and  disrupted  this 
mechanism  of  bringing  production  forward  and  contributed  to  increased  imbalance  between  the 
supply and demand for hydrated ethanol in the country.  

Therefore, the supply of anhydrous ethanol suffered severe restriction at this time, due to being 
in the intercrop period and difficulties in bringing the harvest forward as well as due to the reduction 
in  the  volumes  produced  by  plants  and  a  greater  than  expected  increase  in  demand  for  automotive 
gasoline  18. As a consequence the price of anhydrous ethanol increased substantially, giving rise, for 
the first time, to significant reflexes in the price of gasoline C throughout the country.  

Thus,  a  third  determining  factor  in  the  behavior  of  prices  of  anhydrous  ethanol  and, 
consequently,  of  gasoline  C  (previously  explained  in  the  earlier  section),  was  the  response  of 
consumers to the increase in hydrated ethanol prices. This issue requires observation of the evolution 
of  prices  for  common  gasoline  and  ethanol  between  January  and  May  of  2011  (see  Graph  6).  As 
observed,  from  mid  -  March  2011  onwards,  the  substitution  of  demand  for  hydrated  ethanol  by 
demand for common gasoline led to slowing down of the trajectory of price increase for the former, 
whilst the prices of anhydrous ethanol continued upwards. 

This behavior is well illustrated in Graph 11, which sets out the relationship between the resale 

prices of EHC and of gasoline C in São Paulo between January 2010 and May 2011.

18  It  should  be  noted  here  that  the  production  of  anhydrous  ethanol  tends  to  follow  the  expectations  of  ethanol 
producers as to demand for gasoline. As this demand was higher than expected, the effect of the sugarcane intercrop 
period on the price of anhydrous ethanol intensified.   

16 

 

The limit of 70%19 between the price of gasoline and hydrated ethanol is indicated broken orange 
line  in  the  Graph.  As  Graph  7  indicates,  from  mid-February  onwards,  the  relationship  between  the 
resale prices of EHC and gasoline C favored the consumption of the latter. Consequently, the demand 
for  this  fuel  increased  as  more  consumers  perceived  the  economic  advantage  of  substitution.  This 
movement generated a response in the prices of hydrated ethanol, which, in the light of a reduction in 
demand from early April 2011onwards, receded. This decrease however, was lower than that observed 
in previous years, when, in general, the sugarcane harvest had already occurred.  

The  evolution  of  the  resale  prices  of  gasoline  C  in  the  first  semester  of  2011  is,  therefore,  a 
reflection on the scarcity of supply of anhydrous ethanol during the intercrop period, in a context of 
sustained growth of the participation of flex-fuel cars in the national  fleet of  vehicles. This situation 
was aggravated by the increase in international price quotations for sugar, which encouraged export of 
the product and therefore, greater production of sugar in detriment to ethanol. It was also aggravated 
by the difficulties encountered by the economic agents in bringing forward the sugarcane crushing in 
the  second  bimester  of  2011,  which  further  intensified  the  shortage  of  supply  of  the  product  at  the 
time of increased demand.   

 

7- The Brazilian government reaction 

 
In order to avoid the risk of a shortage of ethanol and with a view to containing the increase in 
the price of fuels the Brazilian government introduced emergency measures, such as (i) a temporary 
reduction in the compulsory percentage blend of anhydrous ethanol a gasoline, which fell from 25% 
to 18%20 and ( ii) permitting the import of ethanol under a differentiated specification. In other words, 
the government, via the ANP21 eased the specification of ethanol fuel to be sold in the country in order 
to facilitate import for the supply of the internal market.  

These measures were mainly temporary and designed to contain any further deterioration in the 
situation until the sugarcane harvest began and supply of the product returned to normal. The first one 
was successful, in the sense that it represented an immediate reduction of approximately 158,000 m3 
in the anhydrous ethanol demand. The second measure impact should be further examined. 

It  should  also  be  noted  that,  given  the  adverse  conditions  for  the  immediate  increase  of  the 
domestic production of ethanol as well as the restrictions on the capacity for the increase of gasoline 
by Petrobras, Brazil was forced to recourse to the import of gasoline and ethanol in order to meet the 
sudden  demand  for  the  fuel  in  the  first  semester  of  2011.  In  order  to  better  understand  the  full 
consequences  of  this  fact  it  is  necessary  to  evaluate,  for  the  year  2011,  the  relationship  between  the 
price  of  gasoline  A  on  the  international  market  and  the  price  of  this  fuel  on  the  national  market,  as 
well  as  the  impact  the  import  of  significant  volumes22  of  gasoline  A  by  Petrobras  in  order  to  meet 
demand on the Brazilian market may have had on the internal price of the product.  

Initially  we  will  set  out  a  comparison  of  the  of  the  gasoline  A  realization  price23;24  charged  by 
Petrobras  and  the  international  reference  price  of  said  fuel,  both  expressed  in  terms  of  R$/l,  for  the 
period  from  January  2008  to  May  201125:26.  The  result  of  this  comparative  exercise  can  be  seen  on 
Graph  12.  Observing  Graph  12,  we  can  infer  that,  given  the  relationship  between  national  and 
international prices for gasoline A, since January 2011there is no advantage, in economic terms, to the 
import  by  Petrobras  of  this  fuel,  particularly  if  such  import  were  to  be  of  significant  volumes  on  a 
regular  basis.  This  situation  is  very  similar  to  that  observed  between  January  and  August  of  2008,

25 As the reference price for gasoline A we used the simple average of the daily price quotation released by Platts for 
gasoline with an octane rating of 87 and 93 on the New York market (The Platts reference contracts are NY UNL 87 
Cargo and NY UNL 93 Cargo)

maintained price stability of gasoline A prices so that the price relation did not provide any incentive 
for the import of this product.

In Graph 13, we sought to carry out the same comparative exercise, this time taking into account 
the  prices  expressed  in  US$/l.  The  aim  was  to  observe  the  effect  of  exchange-rate  variation  on  the 
Petrobras realization price and the relation of such price with the reference price for the international 
market. Based on the observation of Graph 13, we can infer that, given the effect of the exchange rate, 
Brazilian  refinery  price  tends  to  follow  the  trend  in  prices  charged  on  the  international  market.  In 
periods during which there is major variation in international prices however, it can be seen that there 
is  a  substantial  gap  between  the  prices  charged  by  Petrobras  on  the  Brazilian  market  and  those 
practiced  on  the  international  market,  what  could  be  observed  throughout  2011,  making  gasoline 
imports for the Brazilian markets unprofitable.

The  next  step  in  our  analysis  therefore  was  to  verify  the  volumes  of  gasoline  effectively 
imported in 2010 and 2011, as  well as the percentage that they represented in the internal supply of 
this fuel. The objective of this exercise was to evaluate the pressure that the import of gasoline might 
have  on  the  costs  of  the  company  and,  on  that  basis,  call  for  possible  review  of  the  policy  of  price 
stability  currently  in  force  on  the  domestic  market.  We  started  off  with  the  premise  that,  given  the 
significant share of the market held by Petrobras in the refining of petroleum stage and given the lack 
of  economic  attractiveness  of  gasoline  import  in  2001,  95%  of  the  volume  of  imported  gasoline  in 
2011 was imported by Petrobras.  Graph 14, synthesizes this data. One piece of primary information 
extracted is that in  the  months of February and March 2010 (the period in  which the relationship of 
prices was favorable) the imports represented around 15% of the country’s supply of gasoline A. By 
April  2011  this  percentage  was  14%,  falling  to  7%  in  May.  In  August,  the  volume  of  imports  rose 
again, reaching 26% and 27% of the volume produced domestically, respectively.

Thus, imports represent a substantial parcel of the internal supply of gasoline in given months of 
2011  and  occurred  so  as  to  meet  heightened  internal  demand  (which  was  not  being  met  by  internal 
supply, even though this supply was increasing) for fuel used in Otto-cycle vehicles. The main reason 
for the surge in the internal consumption of gasoline  A  was the  migration of consumers of hydrated 
ethanol to gasoline C. This was particularly true in the state of São Paulo and was due to the increase 
in the price of EHC in this period. It should also be noted that this shortage of internal supply occurred 
despite  increased  national  production  of  Gasoline  by  Petrobras  refineries  and  had  significant  impact 
on retail fuel prices.   

It  should  be  noted  that,  despite  being  significant,  the  imports  of  gasoline  A  in  order  to  meet 
internal  demand  occurred  in  a  sporadic  manner:  in  2010  (the  period  in  which  the  price  relationship 
was favorable) 540,000m³ thousand cubic meters were imported between February and April. In 2011 
(when  the  price  relationship  was  unfavorable  to  imports)  408,000m³  of  gasoline  A  were  imported 
between  April  and  May  and  1,773,000,000m³  between  August  and  December  2011.  Despite  being 
intermittent over the year, when the imported volumes are compares with the total annual production 
of  fuel,  it  can  be  seen  that  in  2011  it  represented  around  9%  of  the  total  volume  produced  by  the 
company, whereas in 2010 this proportion was 2.6%, and less than 0.5% in 2009.   

On  the  basis  of  the  above  we  can  conclude  that  in  the  event  of  need  for  import  of  significant 
volumes  of  gasoline  A  in  order  to  meet  internal  demand,  Petrobras  will  do  it.  However,  taking  into 
account  the  current  price  levels  on  the  international  market,  maintaining  the  realization  prices 
currently  charged  by  the  company  on  the  national  market  will  have  a  negative  impact  on  the 
profitability  for  the  company  of  the  sale  of  the  product.  This  may,  in  turn,  give  rise  to  pressure  for 
revision of the current policy of maintaining fuel price stability on the internal market.   

 

VIII - Measures adopted by the government 
 

In  spite  of  the  emergency  measures  that  had  been  taken,  it  became  quite  clear  that  additional 
government  measures  would  be  required  if  the  aim  was  to  minimize  the  effects  in  the  future  of 
possible imbalances in the ethanol fuel market on the gasoline market. This was particularly relevant 
given the growth of the share of flex fuel vehicles in the national automotive vehicle fleet.   

In  this  context  Provisional  Measure  MP  532/2011  was  introduced  and  subsequently  converted 
into Law nº 12.490/2011, transferring the production stage of ethanol to the sphere of competence of 
the ANP. The introduction of Law nº 12.490/2011 therefore represented a major shift in the position 
of  the  Brazilian  government.  Although  the  government  had,  in  the  1970s,  inserted  ethanol  into  the 
national  fuel  matrix,  it  had,  since  then  left  production  under  the  regulation  of  the  Ministry  of 
Agriculture.  In  other  words,  it  was  treated  as  an  agricultural  product  because  its  raw  material  was 
sugarcane. Thus, with passing of the new law, ethanol, which had until then been regulated basically 
with  the  agricultural  markets  in  mind  was  seen  as  an  energy  asset  that  was  fundamental  for  the 
country. This change of regulatory paradigm has a series of institutional consequences for the industry 
and required from ANP to set up a new regulatory regime in order to exercise its new duties. It will 
also need to monitor compliance with the new regulations by the range of agents now falling within 
the scope of ANP regulation.   

One of the main challenges for the Agency is that of guaranteeing the internal supply of ethanol. 
Two  Resolutions  have  been  drafted  to  this  end  (Resolution  ANP  N°66/2011  and  Resolution  ANP 
n°67/2011)  and  its  main  provisions  include  establishing  criteria  for  the  acquisition  and  formation  of 
anhydrous  ethanol  stocks  (in  short,  the  new  resolutions  provide  that  distributors  should  contract  in 
advance anhydrous ethanol and the production plants must maintain ethanol stocks compatible to the 
expected  demand.  Proving  those  contracts  will  be  required  for  the  acquisition  of  gasoline,  and 
noncompliance to the new regulations would imply heavy fines for those caught with no contracts or 
low stocks). 

It can be seen from these new resolutions, particularly ANP Resolution n° 67, that the focus, at 
this initial  stage at least,  will  be on  minimizing the risk of  further shortage in the internal supply of 
anhydrous  ethanol,  which  makes  up  20%  of  the  gasoline  sold  to  the  final  consumer  in  Brazil.  The 
increase  in  the  price  of  anhydrous  ethanol  was  the  principal  factor  responsible  for  the  significant 

20 

 

increase in the price of gasoline experienced in the first semester of 2011 in Brazil.   

Given the short period of time that has elapsed since the issue of the Resolution and given the 
period of time granted by the ANP to enable the economic agents to adapt to the new norms it has not 
yet  been  possible  to  carry  out  a  practical  analysis  of  the  efficacy  of  the  new  ANP  measures  in  the 
ethanol fuel market. Gasoline and ethanol price behavior in 2012 has not yet repeated 2011, as shown 
in graph 15. This result can be most likely attributed, however, to the absence of the factors that lead 
gasoline prices upwards in 2011 (and not to the impact of the new regulations).

It is therefore noteworthy that on November 1, 2011, Petrobras increased by 10% the price for 
the internal market of gasoline from its refineries. On the same day, the Brazilian government reduced 
the CIDE contribution from R$0.19/l to R$ 0.091/l, in other words the CIDE was once again used to 
cushion  the  impact  on  the  price  paid  by  the  final  consumer  of  the  variation  in  fuel  prices.  In  fact 
consumer  prices  have  remained  practically  stable.  However,  given  the  significant  reduction  in  the 
value  of  the  federal  contribution  (CIDE)  the  government’s  power  to  maintain  stability  in  gasoline 
prices on the domestic market without substantially affecting the economic interests of Petrobras and 
its shareholders has been further weakened.   

 
 

IX – Preliminary Conclusions 
 

As has been indicated in this paper, the increase of ethanol and gasoline C market prices in 2011 
was  largely  due  to  (partially)  unforeseen  behaviors  of  the  supply  and  demand  of  both  fuels.  The 
novelty, at least concerning the Brazilian analysts, was the introduction of a new discussion/problem: 
prices  behavior  (particularly  the  analysis  of  the  structural  component  of  the  observed  trend)  and  the 
(so  far  not  observed)  effects  of  the  correlation  between  the  markets  (specially  the  loss  of  Petrobras’ 
capacity to influence automotive fuels consumer prices due to, at least in part, an unintended effect of 
the Brazilian government policy incentives for flex fuel vehicles.  

 It is important to note that the high levels observed in the prices of hydrated ethanol in Brazil in 
2011 may be explained mainly on the basis of typical movements in the market, such as: seasonality

demand  in  recent  years  due  principally  to  the  significant  growth  of  the  fleet  of  biofuel  fuels  and  of 
opportunities to export sugar in a period of high prices on the international market.   

Regarding  the  behavior  of  gasoline  distribution  and  retail  prices  in  early  2011,  it  can  be 
explained  (i) by  the increase  in the volume of  gasoline  C  consumed, particularly in the  state of São 
Paulo,  where,  as  a  result  of  the  significant  increase  in  the  price  of  hydrated  ethanol  fuel  in  the 
sugarcane intercrop period, there was a major migration of consumers to gasoline C, particularly from 
mid  -February/11  onwards;  and  (ii)  by  the  significant  increase  (119.04%)  in  the  price  of  anhydrous 
ethanol fuel, between the first week of January 2011 and the third week of April of the same year, as a 
result  of  the  sudden  pressure  from  demand  facing  a  short  term  inelastic  offer,  since production 
could not be expanded for climatic reasons (in other years supply could be increased in the 
short term by bringing forward the sugarcane harvest).  

In May 2011, with the beginning of the sugarcane harvest, a downward price movement began in 
the  country,  with  the  average  resale  prices  for  hydrated  ethanol  decreasing  14.02%  and  those  of 
common gasoline decreasing 3.47% between the first and last week of May/2011. However, ethanol 
prices  remained,  throughout  the  year  2011,  still  high  when  compared  to  previous  years  (since  there 
were still supply constraints and high international prices for sugar and non fuel ethanol pushing fuel 
ethanol prices upwards). 

In  closing  it  is  important  to  highlight  the  fact  that  Provisional  Measure  532/2011,  of  April  28, 
2011, subsequently converted into Law nº 12.490/2011 conferred on the ANP competence to regulate 
and monitor the national production of ethanol. Putting this into practice, however, required a series of 
fresh  regulations,  which  were  issued  throughout  2011.  Therefore,  the  practical  effects  of  the 
regulatory measures and their impact on the behavior of fuel prices in Brazil have yet to be observed.  
As  Almeida  (2012)27  points  out,  after  the  discovery  of  Pre  Salt  oil  areas,  Brazil  found  itself 
facing the political temptation of keeping domestic fuel prices consistently below those prevailing in 
the  international  market.  Most  oil-exporting  countries  yielded  to  this  temptation,  bringing  large 
negative  impacts  to  their  economic  and  energy  policy.  An  analysis  of  the  current  Brazilian  political 
scene indicates that in the duel between "inflation controls" versus "rational pricing policy", the first 
seems to be taking advantage. However, as indicated in this paper, considering the growing demand 
(and pricing) correlation between gasoline and ethanol Brazilian markets, the artificial maintenance of 
automotive fuel price levels may prove increasingly difficult, if not impossible (at least in the manner 
adopted so far).
