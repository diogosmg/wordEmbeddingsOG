Introduction 

With  the  rise  in  oil  prices  since  2003,  it  has  become  urgent  for  a  lot  of  countries,  even  if for a limited period, to adopt 
pricing  policies  for  oil  products,  particularly  for  gasoline  and  diesel,  in  order  to  fix  their  domestic  prices  at  levels  below  those 
prevalent on the international market. The purpose of these policies is to mitigate inflationary pressures and, therefore, to prevent 
the emergence of popular dissatisfaction, especially in a context also characterized by the rise in food prices. 

It is true that the subsidy on fuel prices is not a recent phenomenon. Over the past decades, several countries, particularly 
the oil exporters, have been setting domestic fuel prices in line with the cost of extraction and not with the international prices. With 
the  rise  in  the  oil  prices  over  the  last  decade,  the  opportunity  cost  of  such  policies has increased for exporting countries. On the 
other  hand,  several  other  countries  have  been  compelled  to  adopt  fuel  pricing  policies,  given  the  strategic  nature  of  this  energy 
input to the economic performance and its inflationary impacts. 

Nevertheless,  the  adoption  of  a  pricing  policy  for  petroleum  products  implies  significant  costs,  especially  for  public 
finances. It is no coincidence that today several countries are considering the implementation of measures to reduce or simply to 
eliminate  fuel  subsidies.  Indonesia’s  government,  which  has  turned  from  an  oil  exporter  to  an  importer  over  the  last decade, has 
faced strong popular resistance against reducing fuel subsidies, whose impact on public accounts are significant (Platts, 2012). In 
Nigeria, the government of President Jonathan had to go partially back on measures to reduce fuel subsidies after a wave of protests 
that swept the country (The Associated Press, 2012). On the other hand, Pakistan and Taiwan recently were successful in reducing 
subsidies measures(Platts, 2012). 

The  aim  of  this  paper  is  thus  to  present  the  main  objective  conditions  that  restrict  one  country's  ability  to  implement  a 
pricing policy in order to decrease the dependence on fluctuations and tendencies of international markets, as well as to illustrate in 
a comparative way the experiences of Brazil and China in adopting such a policy. 

1. 

Objective conditions for the adoption of a pricing policy for petroleum products 

Firstly,  it  is  necessary  to  clarify the main advantages highlighted by economic policy makers by implementing a pricing 
policy  for  petroleum  derivatives.  In  order  to  achieve  this  goal,  we  shall  look  at  the  work  of  the  economist  J.  Tinbergen,  Nobel 
laureate in economics in 1969 and a pioneer in the construction of econometric models. 

According  to  Tinbergen,  achieving  a  number  of  objectives  of  economic  policy  requires that policy makers are provided 
with  the  same number of instruments, otherwise they could face policy dilemmas, depending on the circumstances. For example, 
when  you want to achieve two policy objectives (such as maintaining a certain level of growth with low inflation) with only one 
instrument (e.g. interest rate) there can be a dilemma, because increasing interest rates may contribute to lower inflation but, on the 
other hand, there is an adverse effect on the growth rate. In order to get out of this dilemma, the creation of a new instrument, such 
as  a  pricing  policy  for  petroleum  derivatives,  can  contribute  to  reducing  inflation  without  accepting,  in  turn,  a  reduction  in  the 

economic growth rate. It is important to remember that, generally speaking, fuel prices tend to have significant weight on inflation 
rates, which is why it is very attractive to use fuel prices in order to combat inflation. 

In addition, fuel prices are fundamental to ensure the competitiveness of the economy, given that oil is the main source of 
energy  in  most  countries.  It  is  important  to  note  that  oil,  after  taking  a  key  strategic  role  since  World  War  I,  which  had  been 
emphasized by the oil shocks in the 90’s, the situation changed due to the low price of oil on international markets and  oil came to 
be seen by many analysts as a commodity like any other, without any special strategic importance. 

However,  since  2003,  driven  by  growing  consumption  in  China  and  other  developing  countries,  oil  prices  initiated  a 
period of rising that reflects its intrinsic characteristics: a) low price elasticity of demand, which means that even substantial price 
increases have a low impact on consumption, b) low price elasticity of supply, since oil is a scarce resource and huge investments in 
a  significant  period  of  time  are  necessary  so  that  the  supply  might  increase,  c)  high  income  elasticity  of  the  demand,  given  that 
much  of  the  incremental  demand  for oil is directed to the transportation sector - where consumption is associated with increased 
acquisition  of  vehicles  for  personal  transport  and  transport  of  goods,  whose  behavior  tends  to  follow  closely  GDP.  In  this  new 
scenario, there are no doubts about the role of oil to sustain current levels of living standards and world economic growth. 

Nevertheless, the adoption of a pricing policy for petroleum products detached from those prevailing in the international 
market depends on the existence of objective conditions, whose nature is structural and which vary by country. Put another way, 
adopting a pricing policy in this segment is not possible in the long run without certain requirements that go beyond mere political 
will. 

One of the main constraints is related to the fact of being or not a net importer of oil and oil products. That is because the 
extraction costs are usually substantially lower than the prices in the international markets. In other words, the big surplus generated 
by the oil industry allows flexibility in the determination of petroleum prices, without representing absolute loss of added value to 
the economy. However, when the country is a net importer of oil, the refineries need to acquire from abroad certain proportion of 
oil,  at  prices  set  in  the  international  markets.  As  refining  margins  are  generally  low  compared  to  other  economic  activities  (with 
margins generally below 10%), there isn’t too much space for adopting oil prices very different from those practiced abroad without 
incurring  losses,  at  least  for  that  portion  of  petroleum  derivatives  that  has  been  refined  from  imported  crude  oil.  In  an  extreme 
situation, when the country has to import all the crude oil, even if all the oil was processed by domestic refineries, the oil prices 
could be set at no more than 10% below the prevailing prices on the international market without representing a financial loss to 
refining companies. 

Moreover, depending on foreign exchange restrictions and the weight of oil imports on the trade balance, the adoption of 
domestic  petroleum  product  prices  at  levels  substantially  lower  than  those  in  the  international  market  can  become  even  more 
difficult.  For  countries  whose  currencies  are  not  convertible,  economic  growth  is  limited  by  the  constraints  in  the  balance  of 
payments. Once a country cannot indefinitely accumulate debt, in the long run, according to Thirlwall’s law, the rate of economic 
growth  depends  on the relationship between the rate of export growth and the income elasticity of demand for imports (Thirwall 
and Hussain, 1982). 

The oil trade balance varies considerably over time depending on the levels of crude oil reserves (the supply side) and the 
per  capita  income  (the  consumption  side).  Once  the  oil  trade  balance  is  not  all  static,  there  is  the  political  challenge  of  making 
changes in the petroleum derivatives prices as these objective conditions change. 

It is important to clarify, however, that if the country is a net exporter of oil it will not necessarily adopt a pricing policy 
for petroleum products that increases the distance between domestic and international prices.  It may be undesirable especially if the 
country  wishes  to  increase  energy  efficiency  in  the  input  in  question,  and  it  could  in  the  long  run  harm  the  development  of 
alternative fuels, without considering yet the possible alternative uses of the resources in question . 

However, to a net importer, the adoption of domestic oil products prices below those from the international market means 
that  the  country  should  move  the  surplus  generated  by  the  other(s)  sector(s)  of the economy or by the society as a whole, which 
somehow makes more explicit the costs that are implied for such a policy. 

3                                   Intelligent Well Technology: Status and Opportunities for Developing Marginal Reserves       SPE 

From  this  point,  we  can  insert  the  public  accounts  in  the  debate  about  the  adoption  of  fuel  prices  at  levels  below  those 
established  in  the  international  market.  When  the  country  is  a  major  oil  exporter,  the  conditions  are  more  favorable  to  adopting 
domestic prices different from those practiced on the international markets. But, on the other hand, depending on the conditions of 
public accounts, and the weight of fuel subsidies in relation to tax revenue, the maintenance of this type of policy can be questioned 
by  the policy makers. That is, depending on the difficulties associated to adopt fuel subsidies, it could become more clear to the 
society the substantial costs incurred, as well as the benefits of alternative allocation of resources. It is no coincidence that Saudi 
Arabia studies reducing fuel subsidies, which represents an important source of government spending and leads to inefficient use of 
fuel.  In  recent  years, due to the growing demand for electricity, oil consumption for thermoelectric generation grew substantially 
thus eliminating excessive amount of oil that could be used to increase its export revenues. 

Another  conditional  factor  is  related  to  the  structure  of  the  petroleum  industry.  With  vertically  integrated  companies 
operating in oil production and refining activities, it becomes easier for government to adopt a fuel price policy. The reason for this 
is if a company operates only in refining activity and needs to follow a fuel prices policy determined by government, the firm will 
have to acquire oil as input at market price, which can lead it to incur financial losses, which will make necessary subsidies by the 
government  as  a  way  to  not  disincentive  investments  and  avoid,  in  some  extreme  situations,  the  bankruptcy  of  the  refineries. 
Indeed, when firms are vertically integrated and the whosale fuel prices are set at lower levels compared to input prices, it acts like 
a tax to oil companies. When companies are not vertically integrated, the government could not benefit from this kind of tax, since 
the refineries have losses and the government can, depending on the situation, be called to compensate these losses.  

Another  factor  that  may  hinder  the  adoption  of  derivative  prices  below  the  prevailing  abroad  is  the  existence  of  private 
refineries operating in the country, since they would not accept to operating with losses even if only in the short term. The private 
refineries  can  reduce  or  simply  decide  to  stop  production  of  derivatives  in  order  to  avoid  incurring  losses,  which  may  cause, 
depending on the participation of private refineries in total oil production, domestic supply crisis. As we shall see later, this factor 
plays an important role in China, since the refineries known as "teapots" represent a significant portion of refining capacity. 

Finally, one should not forget that the fuel type ends up interfering in the country's ability to determine the spread between 
international prices vis-à-vis the domestic. For example, in general the prices of jet fuel in different countries tend to behave closer 
to those prevailing in the international market, since it is possible to conduct arbitration in different international airports in order to 
minimize  the  cost  of  fuel  acquisition.  The  same  does  not  happen  with  gasoline  and  diesel,  as  these  tend  to  be  purchased  and 
consumed in the same country (except in regions near the borders), and there may be significant differences in the specification of 
these fuels among the countries, which may turn it impossible to do arbitrage.  

2. Comparing the Brazil and China experiences in adopting fuel prices policy.  

To  better  understand  the  various  factors  that  influence  the  adoption  of  a  policy  of  fuel  prices,  Brazilian  and  Chinese 
experiences  can  be  quite  enlightening.  if,  on  the  one  hand,  needs  to  adopt  a  pricing  policy are present for both countries, on the 
other, the objective conditions that enable the adoption of such a policy has greater restrictions for China than Brazil. 

 
2.1  Historical Background of fuel price policy in Brazil 
 

In Brazil, the oil industry came into being with a strong State presence. With the publication of Decree-Law 395/1938, it 
created the National Fuel Department (DNC) under the Ministry of Infrastructure, aiming to promote the development of national 
production. In this Decree, the oil was declared a public utility, since the state took a major role in the formation of fuel prices in 
Brazil (Lameiras and Giambiagi, 2005). In 1953, from the enactment of Law 2.004/1953, Petrobras was created, a state enterprise 
with a monopoly in exploration, production, transportation and refining of oil and oil products. However, the CNP has retained its 
supervisory powers over the petroleum sector. 

In  the  period  from  1954  to  1964,  ex-refinery  prices  of  petroleum  products  were  based  on  the  cost  of  imported  oil,  the 
single tax and the customs and port charges. However, since 1964, with the enactment of Law 4.452/1964, this pricing criteria was 
modified. It was established that the "ex-refinery price per unit, excluding single tax, of tabulated petroleum products produced in 
the country will be set periodically by CNP, by multiplying the coefficients (...), by the average CIF cost in national currency per 
unit volume of crude oil imported in the previous quarter "(Art. 2 of Law 4.452/1964). It should be emphasized that for aviation 
fuels tax exemptions were to be maintained provided for in Law 1.815/1953, which demonstrated the government's intention in the 
past to encourage the development of the incipient civil aviation industry. 

Thus the CNP had power to increase the coefficients and thus lead to increases in prices of petroleum products in order to 
provide  the  necessary  resources  for  PETROBRAS  so  as  to  implement  its  investment  program.  Moreover,  the  ex-refinery  prices 
were added to other parcels called points, which corresponded to tax in disguise, and so we can obtain the price realization. Adding 
to this distribution and retail margins, we obtain the retail price for consumers. 

In 1966, there was another change in the formula for calculating the prices of petroleum products, with the average price 
realization in the refinery going to be calculated from the sum of four categories of unit costs: 1) costs related to international prices 
of crude oil and other materials imported consumer, whose values also varied depending on the exchange rate, 2) costs related to 
personnel costs, 3) other variable costs that were determined according to the conjuncture of domestic prices, 4) to cover expenses 
with depreciation and amortization, and further ensure the return on capital invested. According to Barbosa (1991), these changes 
were justified based on the following arguments: 

a) Convenience prices of petroleum products are formed on the basis of production costs, the domestic market structure 

and foreign trade; 

b) The need to ensure the refinery profitability in their operations; 

c) The need to become explicit the fiscal protection given to petroleum products in order to carry out proper verification of 

the results of refining operations and thereby secure the resources allocated exclusively to Petrobras investments. 

Thus,  the  immediate  post-war  until  the  first  oil  shock  in  1973  was  a  period  when  there  were  no  reasons  for  adopting 
substantially different prices from on the international market, since the world was the era of cheap oil, and, moreover, Brazil was 
heavily dependent on imported oil. 

According  to  Baer  (1987),  the  increase  in  imported  oil  prices  between  1973  and 1974 was higher than domestic prices, 
since the government tried to cushion the oil shock and dilute its effects over time. Nevertheless, as the Brazilian financial system 
reform  of  1964  had  set  up  a  series  of  measures  leading  to  indexation  of  the  economy, oil shocks led to increase in the inflation, 
whose rates doubled from 1973 to 1974, and thereafter began to float between 30% and 48% until 1979. 

Moreover, with the increases in oil prices, dependence on imported oil produced important implications for the Brazilian 
trade balance. If before oil imports accounted for about 12% of total imports, they already accounted for 23% in 1974. With the 
second oil shock in 1979, this percentage reached about 50%, which helped to push the Brazilian economy to the debt crisis in the 
80s (Fishlow, 1986). 

With  the  oil  crisis,  the  Brazilian  authorities  have  adopted  measures  to  reduce  gasoline  consumption,  such  as:  a)  raising 
gasoline prices higher than those of other derivatives (by 120% between 1973 and 1977, compared with 40% and 50% increase in 
prices  of  diesel  and  fuel  oil, respectively, in the same period, b) implementation of the program PROALCOOL, with the goal of 
creating  a  substitute  for  gasoline,  c)  closing  of  gas  stations  on  weekends  as  a  way  of  discouraging  consumption  (Araujo  and 
Ghirardi, 1986). 

With  the  second  oil  shock  in  1979  and  a  sharp  rise  in  interest  rates  promoted  by  the  chairman  of  the  Federal  Reserve 
(FED),  Paul  Volcker,  Brazil  entered  a  debt  crisis  period,  which  ended  up  exacerbating  runaway  inflation,  since  the  government 
could no longer anchor the expectations of economic agents by controlling the foreign exchange rate. 

In  the  period  from  1984  to  1989,  in the context of accelerating price increases and the succession of economic plans in 
order to stem inflation, fuel prices and public tariffs, increase in the gap had in relation to other goods, which, increased the budget 
deficit, constituting an important source of transfer of the public to the private sector (Carneiro, 2002). 

During  this  period,  prices  of  petrol  and  diesel,  for  example,  accumulated  negative  real  growth  of  25.4%  and  15.2%, 
respectively.  However,  according  to  Baer  (1987),  the  impacts  of  price  controls  by  the  government  had  short-term  effects,  since 
affected companies had to be compensated financially by the government through subsidies or foreign loans to fund the investment 
program and even in some cases, to cover operational costs. Thus, price controls are translated later in increasing the public deficit, 

5                                   Intelligent Well Technology: Status and Opportunities for Developing Marginal Reserves       SPE 

which once exceeded a certain limit, inevitably led the government to raise fuel prices and public tariffs, resulting in a new surge of 
inflation. 

In the Collor administration, the DNC was extinguished, being created in its place the National Petroleum Council (NPC), 

responsible for determining the prices of petroleum products. 

The  process  of  liberalization  of the automotive fuels prices is before the Law 9.478/1997 (known as "Petroleum Law"), 
having been initiated by Ministry of Finance (MF) Act No. 59/1996, which released the sales prices of distributors and dealers for 
gasoline and hydrated ethanol in the South, Southeast and Northeast, as well as the states of Goiás and Mato Grosso do Sul and the 
Federal District. On 13/12/1996, the MF Act No. 292 extended the measure to the states of Tocantins and Mato Grosso, and the 
municipalities of Porto Velho (RO), Manaus (Amazonas) and Belém (PA). The following year, the Interministerial MF / Ministry 
of Mining and Energy (MME) Act No. 293/1997, released the margins of distribution and sale of diesel throughout the country and, 
finally, on 09/03/1999, the Interministerial MF / MME No. 28 released the prices of gasoline and ethanol in places not designated 
by the previous regulations. 

The  prices  of  petroleum  products  in  refineries,  also  controlled,  as  determined  the  Interministerial  MF  /  MME  Act  N° 
3/1998, had their adjustments calculated using parametric formula, systematically remained in force until December 31, 2001. The 
process of deregulation of fuel prices in Brazil was then completed on 01.01.2002, with the replacement of Specific Price Parcel 
(PPE) by Contribution of Intervention in the Economic Domain Charge (CIDE), the release price at refineries and production plants 
and the fall of the legal barriers to the importation of fuel remaining. 

Since the beginning of the deregulation process measures were being taken to eliminate distortions in the functioning  of 
the  market.  These  measures  included  the  release  of  prices,  margins  and  freight  throughout  the  production  chain  and  the  gradual 
elimination  of  subsidies  in  existing  petroleum  products,  and  changes  in  tariff  structure.  It  is  important  to  note  that,  although 
necessary for the implementation of competition in the markets and beneficial to the population, the removal of cross subsidies on 
fuel prices and elimination of freight subsidies led to the rise in prices in some states. 

Currently, therefore, neither ANP nor any other governmental agency regulates, in any form, the prices of automotive fuels 
sold in the country. However, the fact that the majority Petrobras has massive presence in the production and petroleum refining 
and the Union is its main shareholder makes it possible to adopt a fuel prices policy. 

In  an  effort  to  overcome  decades  of  dependence  on  imported  oil,  Brazil  has  over  time  significantly  increased  oil 
production, a process that has gained more impetus with the breaking of the monopoly of Petrobras, achieving self-sufficiency at 
the end of last decade (Figure 1). With the discovery of the pre-salt reserves, the country will become a significant exporter of oil, 
which will ensure greater flexibility for the determination of domestic fuel prices. However, according to Almeida (2012), this new 
condition may be the temptation to have more leeway to practice different prices on the international market, which in the author's 
vision can be quite dangerous, from the standpoint of both the national economy and energy sector.

In the current context of rising oil prices in the international market, Brazil has avoided increasing fuel prices due to fears 
of  inflationary  impacts,  since  the  priority  right  now  is  to  create  conditions  for  reducing  high  interest  rates  to  alleviate  the  public 
deficit and create a favorable environment for an increased investment rate. In 2011, before the price rising of anhydrous ethanol, 
which comprised 25% of gasoline, gasoline prices increased substantially as well, which caused strong dissatisfaction and impacts 
on inflation. The rise of hydrated ethanol made substantially increased gasoline consumption, since a significant proportion of the 
vehicle fleet is flex-fuel in Brazil. Although the country has achieved self-sufficiency to dependence on crude oil, it has not been 
obtained  in  relation  to  consumption  of  petroleum  products.  Thus,  with  the  growth  of  the  economy  and  the  surge  of  demand  for 
gasoline,  Petrobras  has  had  to import gasoline to attend domestic consumption, which puts pressure on the pricing policy, as the 
company incurs losses in this kind of operation (Figure 2), although as a whole presents company profits. However, the investment 
program of about $ 220 billion over the next five years for the extraction of the pre-salt oil reserves also points out limitations in 
this process.

2.2  Historical Background of fuel price policy in China 
 
 

Until  the  reforms  of  the  later  1970s,  energy  prices  in  general,  as  the    price  of  most  of  commodities,  were  wholly  state-
controlled  in  China  (Ma  et  al.,  2009).  In  1981,  “dual-track”  pricing  was  adoped  for  petroleum  products,  within  the  government 
growth strategy of growing-out of the plan through a gradual path (Naughton, 1996).  

In  1994,  the  government  introduced  a  new  price  mechanism,  and  petroleum  products  undertook to be set by the market 
with a single price in the place of a two-tiered price system. In 1998, Chinese government allowed that petroleum prices to be set in 
accordance with Singaporean oil market, but by the condition that prices must be determined by government authorities in line with 
a  new  price  mechanism.  The  gasoline  prices  has  been  set  according  to  average  FOB  Singaporean  crude  oil  price,  and  the 
entreprises had been allowed to determine their whosale and retail prices with a range of 5%, and the differences between whosale 
and retail prices were limited by government (Ni, 2009).  

 

Figure 3. Major Oil Price Reform (1980-present) 

 

 
 
In  2001,  the  price  pegging  system  between  domestic  crude  oil  price  and  Singapore  crude  oil  was  ceased,  and  the  same 
modification was imposed on petroleum products, which had begun to follow the behaviour average of oil products in the markets 
of Singapore, Rotterdam and New York.  But now under the new pricing system, prices adjustments were realized only when oil 
price changes exceeded an amplitude of 8%. This was also the same range of varation of final sales prices of gasoline and diesel. It 
is important to note that this new pricing mechanism was put into pratice when oil prices were at their lowest levels in twenty years. 
In this favourable context, it had not been so difficult to set domestic prices of petroleum in accordance with internacional prices 
(Ni, 2009).  

Nevertheless,  with  the  sharp  increase  in  oil  prices  since  2003,  it  has  become  more  difficult  for  China  following  the 
adjustment  rule  strictly.  In  2005,  the  Chinese  government  linked  oil  product  prices  to  a  weighted  average  of  Dubai,  Brent  and 
Minas crude oil prices, and incorporated to the new pricing system the average processing costs, reasonable rates-of-return, taxes 
and  fees.  However,  the  frequency  of  adjustments  had  not  been  previously  explained  by  the  Chinese  authorities,  so  that  the 
adjustments were still being made based on ad hoc considerations (Zhang, 2008). 

 
The formula was only officially “discovered” in December 2008, when it was clarified that product prices could be revised 
“once average  cost  and  freight  (CFR)  prices  of  the  international  crude markets  over  a  minimum  22  consecutive  working  
days  moved  outside  a  4% fluctuation from the previous period’s weighted crude basket average” (Ni, 2009). The aim of this new 
pricing system was to decrease government interference, but in a context of high volatility of oil prices and rising inflation makes 
difficult  to  follow  the  readjustment  formula.  As  a  result, oil refining and sales firms suffered big losses between 2004 and 2008, 
especially Sinopec, whose operations has been more concentrated in the downstream oil sector, as we can see in the Table 1.

Thus, in the attempt to achieve several objectives with the regulation of fuel prices, China has faced dilemmas of policy. 
The priorities to be achieved with instrument vary according to the economic cycle and political conditions. The situation become 
even  more  difficult  due  to the increasing need for crude oil imports (Figure 4) - priced at international levels - and since private 
refineries - known as "teapots" - hold about 15% of the country’s refining capacity.

The  Chinese  government  does  not  regulate  the  crude  oil  price,  but  the  fact  that  the  country  rely  on  two  large  state 
enterprises vertically integrated and responsible for almost all oil production allows government authorities to set prices at a level 
below the marginal cost of each product (Tan and Wolak, 2009). 

The China Petroleum & Chemical (Sinopec) is the largest refiner in China, which accounts for more than 40% of gasoline 
production in 2005. In addition, Sinopec holds just under 70% of retail market and 51% of capacity refining in the country, while 
China  National  Petroleum  Corporation  (PetroChina)  has  shares  of  30%  and  36%,  respectively  (Tan  and  Wolak,  2009).  Figure  5 
shows the geographic concentration of the three Chinese state companies.

The Chinese government agency responsible for controlling the prices of gasoline and diesel is the National Development 
and Reform Commission (NDRC). In the first half of 2008, before escalating oil prices quoted in international financial markets, 
fuel prices in China were significantly lagging behind those practiced in the rest of world. However, with the outbreak of the serious 
international crisis in October of that year, as well as the economic depression that followed through 2009, the Chinese authorities 
took advantage of the deflationary scenario to establish a policy of readjustment of fuel prices. This policy has three objectives: to 
establish prices that better reflect domestic prices prevailing in the international market; to prevent refiners incurring losses and to 
avoid problems of domestic supply. 

Thus, in early 2009, it was announced that the prices of gasoline and in diesel ex-refinery would be adjusted by reference 
to basket crude oils formed by types of oil, Brent, Dubai and Cinta (Bloomberg, 2009). In addition, PetroChina said in a statement 
that  the  prices  of  fuels  are  also  defined  considering  the  costs  of  transportation  and  processing,  taxes  and  5%  profit  on  refinery 
activity. Meanwhile, the resale taxes on derivatives had increased, reaching RMB 0.8 yuan per liter of gasoline and RMB 0.7 yuan 
per liter of diesel (Eastday, 2011). Finally, the minimum prices resale retail fuels were abolished, and allowed the change of prices 
within the range of 4%, plus or for less than the price of reference set by the NDRC. 

With  the  new  mechanism,  the  NDRC  now  has  the  prerogative  to  adjust  fuel  prices  if  the  moving  average  prices  of  the 
basket of oils in the last 22 days increased by more than 4%. Thus, according to Yin Xiaodong, an analyst at Citic Securities Co., 
the new adjustment mechanism allow refiners to secure profits to an oil price of U.S.$ 80/bbl (in January 2009, prices Brent stood 
at around U.S.$ 50/bbl).  

However, with the increase of oil prices at the first semester of 2011, and the Dated Brent that in April reached the level of 
U.S.  $  126/bbl,  the  mechanism  was  abandoned,  since  inflation  also  began  to  grow  fast  (above  5%  in  April  2011  over  the  same 
month of previous year), driven by rising prices of agricultural commodities - which represent about a third of the price index to 
Chinese consumers. The last adjustment in the price of petroleum products  took place in April 7, 2011, when the NDRC raised the 
wholesale price of regular gasoline to RMB 500 yuan per ton, ie, an increase of RMB 0.37 yuan / liter. Diesel prices rose to RMB 
400  yuan  per  ton,  or  RMB  0.34  yuan  per  liter.  This  was  the  second  price  increase  this  year  and  the  fifth  since  early  2010  (see 
Figure 1). 

In a statement which explains the dilemmas faced by the Chinese authorities with reference to different policy objectives, 
Cao  Changqing,  head  of  the  NDRC  pricing  department,  admitted  that  the  increases  in  fuel  prices  would  add  some  pressure  on 
domestic inflation, but stressed that the two largest oil producers in China, Sinopec and PetroChina, could no longer withstand the 
increasing  gap  in  the  domestic  price  in  relation  to  the  international  price.  He  also  said  at  the  time  that  the  government  would 
provide subsidies to farmers, bus companies and taxi drivers. In the words of the NDRC official statement at the time, "there is an 
urgent need to use price mechanisms as a way to signal scarcity, curbing the excessive fast growth of oil consumption." Moreover, 
"recent  experience  has  indicated  that  the  price  suppression  discouraged  refiners  to  produce  or  import,  leading  to  shortages  of 
products and lines at gas stations". 

In  fact,  the  price  increase  was  intended  to  boost  production  of  smaller  refineries,  known  as  "teapots".  These  refineries, 
according  to  the  NDRC,  have  no  access  to  their  own  supply  of  crude  oil,  which  leads  this  segment  to  purchase  imported  oil  at 
international prices and, consequently, to incur losses in the refining operation. 

 
As  we  can  see  in  Figure  6,  if  in  1995,  gasoline  prices  to  final  consumers  stood  at  levels  below  those  other  selected 
countries,  in  2009  prices  in  the  Asian  country  were  already  higher  than  those  of  Canada  and  the  United  States.  In  2011,  due  to 
inflationary  pressures,  the  Chinese  authorities  have  prevented  much  of  the  variation  in  international  oil  prices  were  passed 
domestically. However, with the cooling of inflation in 2012, and before the recent escalation in oil prices - in terms of geopolitical 
uncertainties because of the new sanctions against Iran - the NDRC is imposing significant increases in fuel prices, and only last 
March two adjustments were made, which signals that the authorities are taking advantage of the opportunity to bring prices closer 
to those prevailing in international markets. With the new adjustments in March, the resale gasoline price in China again exceeded 
the United States’. According to an analyst at China Securities Investment Jianyn, Rui Dingkun, prices in Germany, France, South 
Korea and Japan are relatively high compared to prices in China due to the higher tax burden on fuel and environmental protection 
policies more severe. In China, the sum of the tax is 30%, while the profits of large state enterprises ranging from 6 to 8% on the 
resale prices of fuels

Conclusions 

There have been identified two factors that hinders the Chinese governments control over gasoline prices. First, differently 
from Brazil, where Petrobras owners 99% refinery capacity, in China the private refineries, knows as “teapots”, represent around 
15% of total refinery capacity, which depend on imported petroleum purchases at international prices, that could be substantially 
bigger than domestic prices. In order to assure domestic supply of refined products, the Chinese government obligated the big three 
(Sinopec, CNOOC and CNPC) to sell crude oil at subsidized prices, that results in losses for these enterprises. In the past, the state 
companies  pressured  the  government  to  increase  gasoline  prices  by  reducing  production  in  their  refineries,  resulting  in  rationing 
problems  in  major  cities.  Second,  as  China  depends  increasingly  on  imported  petroleum  purchased  at  international  prices,  the 
governments  decision  in  the  way  of  controlling  gasoline  prices  at  a  level  below  international  prices  must  imply  losses  for  state 
companies.  

Conversely, as Brazil has been self-sufficient in oil since 2006, as well as the majority of petroleum products being refined 
domestically, the pricing policy adopted does not necessarily imply losses to the Petrobras Group, since the extraction and refining 
costs are not higher than domestic gasoline prices. Then, it is easier for the Brazilian government to minimize the impact of higher 
international  oil  prices  on  domestic  prices  of  oil  products,  since  this  measure  does  not  imply  supply  problems,  neither  absolute 
losses  for  Petrobras  Group. As a consequence, the Brazilian government can define gasoline prices at some moments higher and 
others below international prices. As Petrobras has a monopolistic condition in many other markets, such as jet fuel and natural gas, 
the  company  can  inflate  these  prices  to  reduce  its  possible  losses  incurred  in  gasoline,  diesel  and  LGP    -  cylinders  of  13kg  for 
residential consumers (historically, this last is sold at highly subsidized rates).

However,  China  reducing  the  share  of  the  private  sector  in  refining  activity,  considered  by  authorities  inefficient,  the 
growing dependence on imported oil will make it more difficult to sustain prices below those prevailing in the international market 
over  the  long  term.  One  solution  has  been  found  to  resort  to  long-term  contracts  to  supply  provisions  to  prevent  the  immediate 
transfer of the variations in the spot market. However, as contracts for the supply of long-term oil still represent a small percentage 
of imported oil, pressures for a more automatic alignment of pricing will increase in the short term, particularly in the scenery of 
continuing inflation pressures.
